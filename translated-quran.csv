6|137|Likewise, a decoration of many of the polytheists has been adorned with the killing of their children. You see
6|138|And they said this is a pseudo and a stitch that does not benefit from it except for those who have seen themselves with their claim ۚ They will reward them with what they were fascinating

6|155|And this is a book that we have come to be blessed, so follow it and fear that you may be merciful
6|156|To say that the book is revealed to two sects before us, and if we are from their studies, they are forgiven
6|157|Or you say that if the book is revealed to us, we have been guided by them. And we will be shocked by us who will be the ones who believe in our signs of mismanagement of what they were to believe
6|158|Do they look at them except for the angels to come to them, or your Lord will come or come to some of the signs of your Lord You are before or earned in her faith better ۗ Say: Wait, I am waiting
6|159|Those who dispersed their religion and were a Shiite of them in something ۚ But their command to God and then he predicts them from what they did.
6|160|Whoever comes with goodness has ten times like it ۖ and whoever comes with the bad, then it is only permissible for the same and they are not wronged
6|161|Say: I am guided me, my Lord, to a straight path, a valuable religion of Abraham Hanif ۚ and what was among the polytheists
6|162|Say that my prayers, my souls, my life, and my mother to God, the Lord of the Worlds
6|163|There is no partner for him ۖ and I have been commanded and I am the first of the Muslims
6|164|Say the most important of God, the Lord, and he is the Lord of all things. You are what you were in it
6|165|And he is the one who made you the caliphs of the earth and raised some of you above some of the codes to let you be in what you have come
7|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
7|2|A book that is revealed to you, so there is no embarrassment in your chest.
7|3|Follow what you have been descended from your Lord, and do not follow without him.
7|4|And from a village that we have, we have come to her, or they said, or they said
7|5|What they called them when they came to them, except that they said: We were unjust
7|6|Let us ask those who were sent to them, and let us ask the messengers
7|7|Let us shorten them with a knowledge.
7|8|And the weight of the right to the truth.
7|9|And whoever has hidden his balances, those who have lost themselves with what they were with our signs.
7|10|And I have enabled you to the earth and made us in it.
7|11|And we created you, then we photographed you, then we said to the angels, they found for the Adam, so they found only an elderly
7|12|He said: What prevented you from not prostrating when I commanded you. He said that I was better than it.
7|13|"He said, ""So what is it for you to be arrogant in it, and it will be brought up."""
7|14|He said to me to the day they are sent
7|15|He said that you are from the eyes
7|16|He said, as you have seen me, I would not be taken to them.
7|17|Then they came to them from their hands and from their successors and their faiths and their shams ۖ and do not find their most like
7|18|He said that he was brought up with a muddow
7|19|And you are the oldest of you, and you are your husband, so you will be from where you will, and this tree will not come close to, so we will be from the oppressors
7|20|So the Satan is whom the Satan is to them to seem to them what was brought up from them Creators
7|21|And their division is that I am for those who advise
7|22|So they have been broken down. A lion and less for you, that Satan is a clear enemy
7|23|"We said, ""We have been unjust, and if you do not forgive us, and we will be merciful to us."
7|24|"He said, ""Get up with each other for some enemy."
7|25|They said that they live, and they will die
7|26|O children of Adam, we have revealed to you a dress that will be given to your affairs
7|27|O son of Adam, the Satan does not give you as a result of the paradise. And they ۗ We have made us the two guardians of those who do not believe in
7|28|And when they did obscene, they said, and we found us, our fathers, and God commanded us to do it.
7|29|Say: I command my Lord in the installment 😂 and establish your faces with every mosque and invite him to the debt of the religion.
7|30|A partner who guided them and a partner who has the right to delusion ۗ They took the devils as guardians without God
7|31|O son of Adam, take your adornment with every mosque, eat, drink, and do not seek ۚ, for he does not love those who seek.
7|32|Say: Whoever forbids the adornment of God, who is brought out to his servants and the kindness from the sustenance. The verses are for people who know
7|33|Say: The Lord of the Fawafi has forbidden what appeared from it, and what is stomach, and the sinner, and the prostitutes. What do you not know
7|34|And for every nation for a long
7|35|O sons of Adam, or for you, a messenger from you, who are excluded from you.
7|36|And those who lied to our verses and arrogated from them, those who are the owners of the fire.
7|37|So whoever is hurt by those who are foolishly for God, or lied to his revelations ۚ Those are their share of them from the Book. Where are you calling without God?
7|38|He said: Enter in the nations that I have been disturbed by the jinn and the human being in the fire. O God, our Lord, these people, we have lost themselves with a weak torment of fire.
7|39|The first of them said to the last of them, so what was for us from the grace of us, so they taste the torment of what you were.
7|40|For those who lied to our revelations and arrogant from them, do not open to them the doors of the heavens, and do not enter the paradise until the authority of the Grif
7|41|They have a domestication of hell, and from them by a ghost.
7|42|And those who believed and do righteous deeds, we do not cost a soul except for their sins, those who are the owners
7|43|And we are removed from the rituals of the rivers The messengers of our Lord, with the truth, have come to you.
7|44|And the companions of Paradise called on the owners of the fire that we have found what our Lord has truly God is on the oppressors
7|45|Those who repeat the path of God and want them to be a wavy, and they are the hereafter.
7|46|And among them is a veil ۚ and on the families of men who know all of them with their hands ۚ and they called on the companions of Heaven that God has forgotten it
7|47|"And when their eyesight is in the hands of the owners of the fire, they said, ""Our Lord, do not make us with the unjust people"
7|48|And the companions of the families called on men who know them with their saints, they said what I have risked about
7|49|Dear people who have divided themselves, God does not have mercy on them.
7|50|And the owners of the fire called on the owners of Paradise to be overwhelmed by the water or from what God has given you
7|51|Those who took their religion for a fun and a game, and the worldly life deceived them ۚ So the day we forget them as they forgot to meet the day of their day
7|52|And we came to them with a book, so we concluded it with a gift and a mercy for people who believe in
7|53|Do they look at him except for his interpretation? We want to do so that we were doing ۚ They lost themselves and misled them from what they were fascinating
7|54|For your Lord, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then he is equal to the throne, the night is cheated Trees with his command ۗ He does not have creation and the matter ۗ God bless you, Lord of the two worlds
7|55|Call your Lord, and hidden.
7|56|And do not spoil the earth after its prayers, and let him be afraid and greed ۚ If the mercy of God is close
7|57|And he is the one who sends the winds between the hands of his mercy. All the fruits ۚ like that we will come out of death, so that you may remember
7|58|And the good country comes out of his prophethood with the permission of his Lord ۖ and who has been disturbed, he does not come out except to confirm ۚ Like we, we will tell the verses of the rituals
7|59|We have sent Noah to his people, and he said: O people, worship God, what you have from God, other than him, I am afraid of you
7|60|He said the fullness of his people.
7|61|He said, O people
7|62|I tell you the messages of my Lord, I advise you, and I know from God what you do not know
7|63|You liked that a male of your Lord has come to you for a man from you to warn you and fear you
7|64|So they lied to him, so we saved him and those with him in the ark, and we immersed those who lied to our verses ۚ They were a blind people
7|65|And until their brother returned, he said: O people, worship God, what you have from God other than him ۚ Do you not fear
7|66|The mortality who disbelieved from his people said that we will see you in a curl, but we think you are among the liars
7|67|He said, O people, there is no sorry for me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.
7|68|I tell you the messages of my Lord, and I have a safe advice
7|69|I liked that a male of your Lord has come to your Lord for a man from you to warn you ۚ and remember when he made you a successor from you Come on the family of God, so that you may be successful
7|70|They said: We have come to worship God alone and warn what he worshiped our parents.
7|71|He said that your Lord has fallen upon you, anger and anger. Waiting
7|72|So we saved him and those with him with mercy from us, and we cut off the people of those who lied to our verses.
7|73|And to the thorns of their brother righteously ۗ He said: O people You eat in the land
7|74|And remember, when he made you a successor from after returning, and you will be in the land In the land, they are spoiled
7|75|The pain who have been arrogant from his people, who are weakened by those who have been weakened by those who believe in those who believe َ
7|76|Those who arrogated said: We who believed in
7|77|So, they were the camel and gave up the command of their Lord, and they said: O righteous, come to us with what we prepared if you are from the messengers
7|78|So the treasure took them, and they became in their house.
7|79|So he took care of them and said: O people, I have notified you.
7|80|And in terms, when he said to his people, you will come to the obscenity.
7|81|You are the men of the men without women.
7|82|And the opponents of his people were not only if they said that they would come out of your village ^ They are people who purify themselves
7|83|So we and his family were saved, except for his wife.
7|84|And our rain for them is a rain.
7|85|And to the religion of their brother, he said: O people The people are their things, nor do you spoil the earth after their prayers ۚ That is better for you if you are believers
7|86|And do not fall into every path that you will promise, and you will be reluctant to the path of God who believed in him The title of spoils
7|87|And if a group of you believed in the one I sent with it and a group that did not believe, then be patient until God bless you
7|88|The mortality who arrogated from his people said that we will leave you, O people
7|89|We have avoided God as a liability if we are in your fullness after that, God bless us from it. Wana ۚ God bless us ۚ Our Lord, open between us and between our people with the truth and you are the best of the conquerors
7|90|The mortality who disbelieved from his people said that if you follow the people, then you are the losers
7|91|So the treasure took them, and they became in their house.
7|92|Those who lied to the people as if they did not sing in it ۚ Those who lied to the people were the losers
7|93|So he took care of them and said: O people
7|94|And what we sent in a village from a prophet, except we took it with the misfortunes and harm
7|95|Then we have the place of good lying until they were pardon
7|96|If only the people of the villages believed and fear, then we will open to them with blessings of heaven and earth
7|97|Is it safe for the people of the villages to come to them with our homes, and they are sleeping
7|98|Or the people of the villages, to come to them with the sacrifice of them, and they are playing
7|99|Do the deception of God ۚ So do not believe in the deception of God except the losing people
7|100|Was it not guided to those who inherit the land after their people, if if we had the emergence of their sins, we have their sins.
7|101|Those villages are shortened by you from their prophets ۚ And their messengers came to you The disbelievers
7|102|And we did not find them more than a covenant.
7|103|Then we sent us to Moses with our verses to Pharaoh and his roots, so they will be wronged with it.
7|104|Moses said, O Pharaoh, that I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
7|105|A fact that I do not say to God except the truth.
7|106|He said that if you came with a verse, then come to her if you are the truthful
7|107|He threw his stick, and if it is a clear snake
7|108|And we are removed from his hand, so if it is a white for the visionary
7|109|The fullness of the people of Pharaoh said that this is a knowledgeable witch
7|110|He wants to come out of your land.
7|111|They said, “I ask him and his brothers, and send in the sects, people.
7|112|They come to you with every knowledgeable magician
7|113|And the magician came to Pharaoh, they said that we do not pay.
7|114|He said yes, and you are among those who are close
7|115|They said, Moses, either to be met, or that we are the ones who are met
7|116|They said: When they were thrown, they were sacrificed, the eyes
7|117|And we referred to Moses to throw your stick.
7|118|The truth fell and the heroes of what they were doing
7|119|So they are overwhelmed by you and moved two young people
7|120|And the magic dubbed two prostrations
7|121|They said, believe in the Lord of the two worlds
7|122|Lord Moses and Harun
7|123|Pharaoh said that you believed in it before I have ears for you. This is a deception that you have deed in the city, so that they may come out of it.
7|124|To cut off your hands and your feet from a success
7|125|They said: To our Lord, they are dismissed
7|126|And you do not take from us except that we believe in the verses of our Lord, when we have come to us.
7|127|And the fullness of the people of Pharaoh said that Moses and his people will be spoiled to spoil the earth and he will be destroyed They are sacrificed
7|128|Moses said to his people, seek help from God and be patient.
7|129|They said, “We are in our minds before you come to us, and after what you have come to us ۚ He said,“ Your Lord, that your enemy will be destroyed
7|130|We have taken the family of the Sunnahs and a deficiency of the fruits, so that they may remember
7|131|So if the good comes to them, they said to us that this is a bad thing It is
7|132|And they said what you brought us from a verse that you will be enchanted by it, so what we do not have for you.
7|133|So we sent them the flood, the mortality, the lock, and the defending, and the blood, and the signs of separate, so they arrogated and they were the people of the people
7|134|And when the ritual signed upon them, they said: O Moses, pray for your Lord with what I have covenant with you.
7|135|When we revealed them to them, for the sake of them, they are in their language, if they are
7|136|So we resided from them, and we impeded them in the day that they lied to our verses and they were unaware of them.
7|137|And we inherited the people who were weakening Patience with us and destroy us, what would have been made of Pharaoh and his people, and what they were raising
7|138|And we won the sons of the sacrifice of the sea, so they came to a people who are working on the idols of them. They are ignorant
7|139|If they are prevalent, what they are in and in vain of what they were doing
7|140|He said, “He will want you to God, and He is your best over the worlds.
7|141|And when we saved you from the family of Pharaoh, they will pray for you, bad torture, and they will kill your children, and they will be ashamed of your women ۚ
7|142|And Moses returned to us, three nights, and we have been completed by ten, so the meeqaat of his Lord was folded for forty nights. Follow the two spoils
7|143|And when Moses came to our life and his Lord spoke to him, the Lord said: I see me. His Lord will spoil the mountains, make him a height and make Moses shock ۚ When he agreed, he said, Glory be to you, and I am the first
7|144|He said, Moses, that I have chosen you on people with my messengers and my words, so take what I have come
7|145|وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُ فِي الْأَلْوَاحِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مَوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلًا لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُوا بِأَحْسَنِهَا ۚ سَأُرِيكُمْ دَارَ الْفَاسِقِينَ
7|146|I will know about my verses who are arrogant in the land, without the truth, and if they see every verse, they will not believe in it The way the absence takes it as a way ۚ This is that they lied to our verses and they were unaware of them.
7|147|And those who lied to our verses and met the hereafter.
7|148|And the people of Moses took from his life from their hurricanes a body that has horses with him?
7|149|And when they fell in their hands and saw that they had gone astray, they said: “We did not have mercy on us, our Lord, and forgive us.
7|150|And when Moses returned to his people, he was a slope, he said: “You were called me after me.” To him ۚ The son of a mother said that the people have weakened me and almost kill me, so you will not smell the numbers, and do not make me with me
7|151|Lord, forgive me and my brother, and enter us in your mercy.
7|152|Those who took the calf will be angry with their Lord and humiliation in this world
7|153|And those who did the misfortunes and then repent from her after them and believe that your Lord after her is forgiven
7|154|And when Moses, the anger, took the openness, and in its dirty, it is a gift and a mercy for those who are their Lord, they are frightened
7|155|And Moses chose his people for seventy men to our merits. Aa from us 😂 If it is only your affliction, you will be misled by whom you want and guide those you want.
7|156|And write to us in this worldly good, and in the hereafter, we guided us to you. Where they fear and pay zakat, and those who are in our verses believe in
7|157|Those who follow the Messenger of the Prophet who finds it, who are written in them in the morning Bat, and the hidden ones are forbidden to them, and their support is placed on them, and the rags that were on them. Decorate with him ۙ Those who are the ones
7|158|Say, O people, I am the Messenger of God to all of you who have the king of the heavens and the earth. He who believes in God and his words and follow him, so that you may be guided
7|159|And from the people of Moses, a nation that guides the truth and with it they are modified
7|160|And we have interrupted them with the twelve causes of nations ۚ and we have revealed to Moses, when his people got used to him A eyes 😂 He knew all the people of their drink. They were themselves
7|161|And when they were said to them, they rested this village, and they eaten from it, where you were, and they said, and they will enter the door, and we will be forgiven.
7|162|So those who have been wronged from them changed a saying other than those who were said to them, so we sent them to them, as a result of the heavens of what they were wronged
7|163|And ask them about the village that was present in the sea, when they are prepared in the Sabbath, when they come to them. It is the same as the Nabat them of what they were immoral.
7|164|And when a nation said from them, you did not exalt the people ۙ God is their ownership or torture them with severe torment.
7|165|When they forgot what they remembered, we have been overwhelmed
7|166|When they came to what they forbade them, they said to them that they were a miserable monkey.
7|167|And when your Lord gave permission to send them to the Day of Resurrection, whoever blesses them is bad torture
7|168|And we cut them in the land a nations ۖ among them are the righteous and from them without that.
7|169|So he succeeded after them, and they inherited the book, they take the presentation of this low Take the covenant of the book to them that they do not say to God except the truth and study what is in
7|170|And those who hold the book and establish the prayer, but we do not waste the reward of the righteous

10|9|Those who believe and do righteous deeds give them their Lord with their faith.
10|10|They called them in it, peace be upon you, and greet them with peace.
10|11|And if God has accelerated the evil of evil, they will hurry them with good, he would have spent their sake to them.
10|12|And when the human being touches the harm, we call for it, or a sit -in, or a standing, when we revealed it to him, as if he did not They were drunk what they were doing
10|13|And the people of the century have weeded us before you, when they did wrong, and their messengers came to their sons, and they would not have believed.
10|14|Then we have made you a caliph in the land after them, so that we can look at how you work
10|15|And when our signs are followed by themselves, he said: “Those who do not hope for us to meet us with a Qur’an other My soul 😂 If I follow except what is revealed to me 😂 I am afraid that I disobey my Lord, the torment of a great day
10|16|Say, if God wills what you have been upset with you, nor did I know you with it.
10|17|Whoever is more darkened by those who fascinated God as a lie or a lies with his verses ۚ He does not spare the criminals
10|18|And they worship without God ۚ Glory be to him and the Most High
10|19|And the people were only one nation, and they were disagreed with ۚ and if only a word that preceded your Lord, he would have spent between them in what they are in which they are dispensed
10|20|And they say that if only a verse of his Lord will be revealed to him, then say, but the unseen is for God, so they are waiting for you to wait for you
10|21|And when people have given us mercy after the harm of their touch, when they have a deception in our signs ۚ Say God is the fastest of a good
10|22|He is the one who walks you in the righteousness and the sea. They thought that they were surrounded by them ۙ They called God, who had the debt to Him, while we saved us from this
10|23|When they saved them, when they want to the earth, without the truth, O people You are what you were doing
10|24|But the same life is the same You have thought that they were unable They think
10|25|And God calls to the house of peace and guides whoever wills to a straight path
10|26|For those who are good, good and increased ۖ, and their faces are not subjugated, and no humiliation.
10|27|And those who have earned the misfortunes are bad for them, and their humiliation is humiliated. ۚ Those are the owners of the fire.
10|28|On the day we gathered all of them, then we say to those who have joined your place you and your partners ۚ, so we will come to them between them.
10|29|So God suffices a martyr between us and between you, if we are your worshipers, to forgive
10|30|Here is your soul
10|31|Say: Whoever provides you with heaven and the earth is the right of the hearing and the eyes And God ۚ Say: Do you not fear?
10|32|May God grant you the truth.
10|33|You have the words of your Lord to those who were immoral that they do not believe in
10|34|Say: Is your partner who begins creation and then restores it?
10|35|Say: from your partnership, who guides the truth? Ruling
10|36|And most of them follow except for thinking.
10|37|And this was not the Qur’an to be fled without God, but it is true that he is between his hands and the separation of the book is not in it
10|38|Or do they say it is fascinated by it 😂 Say: So come with a wall like him and call those who can be able to be without God if you are true
10|39|Rather, they lied to what they did not surround his knowledge, and when they came to them, his followers ۚ Licked to you, who lied to those before them.
10|40|And among them is those who believe in it, and some of them do not believe in it ۚ and your Lord knows the spoils
10|41|And if you lied to you, say to me my work and to you your deeds.
10|42|And among them who listens to you ۚ Did you hear the deaf and if they were not reasonable?
10|43|And among them is those who look at you?
10|44|God does not oppress people for anything, but people themselves are oppressed
10|45|And on the day, they will be gathered, as if they did not broadcast except for an hour of the day, and they would know between them ۚ He lost those who lied to those who lied, and they did not.
10|46|As for you to show you some of whom we promise or die you, then we will return them, then God is a martyr on what they do
10|47|And for every nation of a messenger, then if their Messenger comes, they judge between them in installments, and they do not oppress
10|48|And they say when this is a promise if you are true
10|49|Say: I do not have a harm for myself, nor benefit, except for what God wills ۗ for every nation for a sake ۚ If they come, then there is no delay.
10|50|Say: You have seen that you will be tormented or an alent
10|51|Then if you did not fall into it ۚ Now that you were hurrying to it
10|52|Then it was said to those who did wrong to the torment of the immortality.
10|53|And they will tell you the most right is ۖ Say to me and my Lord that he is a right 😂 and what you are in my miracle
10|54|And even if every soul has injustice, what is in the land, it would not have expanded it ۗ and the captivity of the dedication, when they saw the torment of them, and the one who is in the authority of them.
10|55|Unless God is in the heavens and the earth, except that the promise of God is a right, but most of them do not know
10|56|It revives and dies, and to it you will return
10|57|O people, you have come to your Lord and a cure for what is in the breasts, guidance and mercy for the believers
10|58|Say the preference of God and his mercy, so let them be happy, it is the best of what they are
10|59|Say: You have seen what God has revealed to you from a liveli
10|60|And whoever thinks those who break the day of the resurrection of the Day
10|61|And what you are in a matter of time, and what you are recited In the earth, nor in the sky, nor is it small
10|62|No, the guardians of God are not afraid of them, nor are they grieving
10|63|Those who believe and fear
10|64|They have the human being in this worldly life and in the hereafter ۚ Do not look for the words of God ۚ That is the great win
10|65|And their saying is not sad
10|66|Unless God is in the heavens and who is on the earth ۗ and what follows those who call from God without blessings ۚ If they follow the
10|67|He is the one who made you the night for you to be dwell in it and the day is insightful ۚ in that there are no signs of people who hear
10|68|قَالُوا اتَّخَذَ اللَّهُ وَلَدًا ۗ سُبْحَانَهُ ۖ هُوَ الْغَنِيُّ ۖ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ إِنْ عِنْدَكُمْ مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ بِهَٰذَا ۚ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ
10|69|Say: Those who fascinate God, the liar, do not succeed
10|70|The enjoyment in this world, then we will return them, and then give them the hardship of the hardship of what they were atoning
10|71|And the prophecy of Noah is a source of them, when he said to his people, O people You, then your command is not over to you, and then spend to me and do not look
10|72|فَإِنْ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَمَا سَأَلْتُكُمْ مِنْ أَجْرٍ ۖ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ ۖ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ
10|73|So they lied to him, so we saved him, and whoever has with him in the ark, and made them Khalifa, and we immersed those who lied to our verses.
10|74|Then we sent a messenger to their people, so they came to them with the evidence, so they would not have believed Yen
10|75|Then we sent from them Moses, and they went to Pharaoh and fill him with our verses, so they arrogated and they were a criminal people.
10|76|When the truth came to them from us, they said that this is a clear magic
10|77|"Moses said, ""Do they say to the truth when you came to you."""
10|78|They said: We have come to our wrap
10|79|And Pharaoh said: I came to me with every knowledgeable magician
10|80|When the magic came, Moses said to them.
10|81|When they were thrown, Moses said what you have come to magic.
10|82|And God is right in his words, even if the criminals hated it.
10|83|What is safe for Moses except an offspring of his people on fear of Pharaoh and their fullness to be fascinated
10|84|Moses said, O people
10|85|So they said to God, our Lord, we will not make us a temptation for the unjust people
10|86|And we saved your mercy from the disbelieving people
10|87|And we referred to Moses and his brother to show your people with Egypt, and make your homes a kiss and the righteousness of the prayer
10|88|"Moses said, ""Our Lord, that you have come to a pharaoh and a fill it in the life of the worldly life. In their hearts, they do not believe until they see the perfect torment"
10|89|He said, I have answered you, and you will not be up.
10|90|And we won the sons of the sacrifice of the sea, so they followed them, and his soldiers are loud and enemy. I have the children of Israel, and I am one of the Muslims.
10|91|Now you have been disobeyed before and you were from the spoils
10|92|Today we will save you with your body to be for those who have succeeded you with a verse ۚ and many people from our signs are unjust
10|93|And we have been brought up with the children In which they are disappeared
10|94|If you are in doubt from what we have revealed to you, then ask those who read the book from before you ۚ The truth has come to you, then the truth is from your Lord, so there is no one who is from your Lord
10|95|And do not be among those who have lied to the verses of God, so you will be among the losers
10|96|Those who have the right to have the words of your Lord do not believe in
10|97|And if every verse came to them until they would see the perfect torture
10|98|Were it not for a village that would have believed, then its faith would benefit it except the people of Yunusia, when they believed, we will reveal the torment of the sake of the sake
10|99|And if your Lord will not believe in all of them all the earth.
10|100|And it would not have been for the same
10|101|Say: Look at the heavens and the earth.
10|102|Do they wait except for the days of those who have left before them ۚ Say: So wait for you to wait for you
10|103|Then we save our messengers and those who believe in
10|104|Say, O people, if you are in a doubt of my debt, do not worship those who worship from God without God Yen
10|105|And do your face upright for religion and do not be among the idolaters
10|106|And do not call without God what does not benefit you and do not harm you. If you do, then you are from the unjust
10|107|And if God holds you with harm, then he will not reveal to Him except He 😂 And if he returns you with good, then he does not want to prefer him ۚ He will be with him who is good
10|108|Say: O people, the truth has come to you from your Lord ۖ Whoever is guided, then he will be guided to himself ۖ
10|109|And follow what is revealed to you and be patient until God rules ۚ and it is the best of the rulers
11|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
11|2|Do not worship except God ۚ I have a vow from him for him
11|3|And for your Lord, then seek forgiveness for him, then you can enjoy good luck to a good time, and all those who are good will be given to you A great day
11|4|To God, you will return
11|5|Unless they make their breasts to be hidden from it ۚ No, when they seek their garment, they know what they are pleased with and what they are not.
11|6|And there is no dump in the land except for God, and he knows its stable and its rituals ۚ Each in a clear book
11|7|And it is the one who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and it was his throne on the water, so that you can bless you You will say those who disbelieve if this is only a clear magic
11|8|And if the torment is taken away from them to a numbers, they will say what they are holding َ
11|9|And if the man has tasted us from us, then we removed it from it, because it is a disbeliever.
11|10|And if we have given him a blindness after the harm of his touch, they would say the misfortunes of the misfortunes of me ۚ It is a joy
11|11|Except those who have been patient and do righteous deeds of those who have forgiveness and a great reward
11|12|Perhaps you will be exalted, some of what is revealed to you. Kele
11|13|Or do they say it is fascinated by it.
11|14|Do you not respond to you, know that I will come down to the knowledge of God, and that there is no god but He is He.
11|15|Whoever wants this worldly life and its adornment is a delegation to them their work in it and they are in them.
11|16|Those who are not in the hereafter except for fire ۖ And they are overwhelmed by what they made in it and the falsehood of what they were doing
11|17|Will it be a clear one of his Lord, and he will recite him from him The fire is its prestige ۚ Do not be in a bitterness from it ۚ It is the truth from your Lord, but more people do not believe in
11|18|And whoever is the most darkened of those who are fled to God as a lie ۚ Those are exposed to their Lord The unjust
11|19|Those who repent from the path of God and want them to be a wave, and they are the hereafter.
11|20|Those are not the miracle of the earth, and they were not from God from the guardians of God َ
11|21|Those who lost themselves and their soul
11|22|There is no crime that in the hereafter they are the ones who are lost
11|23|Those who believed, do righteous deeds, and they have been disturbed to their Lord, those who are the owners of Paradise.
11|24|The same as the two parties, such as blindness, deaf, visionary, and hearing?
11|25|We have sent Noah to his people.
11|26|If you do not worship except God.
11|27|So he said the pain who disbelieved from his people. Rather, we think you are false
11|28|He said, O people, you saw that if I had a sons from my Lord, and I have mercy on me from him, then I would have gone to you, and you will be blessed with you, and you will be blessed
11|29|O people, I do not ask you for money.
11|30|And the people of those who support me from God, if I want them ۚ Do you not remember?
11|31|And I do not say to you for me, the cabinets of God, and I do not know the unseen, nor do I say that I am a king The shares of the unjust
11|32|They said, Noah
11|33|He said that God will come to you if he wills
11|34|And we do not benefit you, if I want to advise you if God wanted you to fool you ۚ He is your Lord and to Him you will return
11|35|Or do they say it is fascinated by it.
11|36|And I was revealed to Noah that he will not believe in your people except for those who have believed, do not despair of what they did
11|37|And make the ark with our eyes and our life, and do not address me in those who wronged them.
11|38|And the rhetoric is made, and when it passed through it, the fullness of its people is ridiculed from it.
11|39|So you know whoever is a torment that he shares and shames him, and he will have a valuable torment for him
11|40|Until our command came and the enlightenment is available, we say that you will carry in it from all two wives and your family except for those who have come to him and the one who is upon him
11|41|"And he said, ""Play in it in the name of God, its course and its anchors."" My Lord is forgiven"
11|42|And she runs with them in a wave like a mountain, and Noah called his son, and he was in isolation, my children
11|43|He said to me to a mountain that he blinds me from the water.
11|44|It was said, O Lord of my water, and you, the sky of my lord, the waters of the water, and the matter of the matter, and it is equal to the goodness.
11|45|And Noah called his Lord, and my Lord said that my son is from my family, and your promise is the truth and you are the ruling of the rulers
11|46|He said, Noah, that it is not from your family ۖ It is a good deed.
11|47|My Lord said that I seek refuge in you that I ask you what I have no knowledge.
11|48|It was said, O Noah.
11|49|That is from the prophets of the unseen, which we do not have to you.
11|50|And until their brother returned to Huda ۚ He said, O people, worship God, what you have from God other
11|51|O people, I do not ask you for a reward.
11|52|And the people, seek forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to Him, send the sky to you, and increase you a force to you, to your strength, and not to you.
11|53|They said, O Hood, what you have come to a statement, and what we have to do is your family, our words, and what we are with you with believers
11|54|If we say that some of our gods will be misunderstood you with misfortune
11|55|Without him 😂 So they assure me all and then do not look
11|56|I have reluctant to God, my Lord and your Lord ۚ There is nothing but a bond that he takes with her sins ۚ My Lord is on a straight path
11|57|If they took over, then I will note what I have sent to you ۚ and my Lord will be used as a people other than you, nor do you harm anything.
11|58|And when our command came, we saved us, and those who believed with him with mercy from us, and we saved them from a thick torment
11|59|And that is back.
11|60|And follow in this worldly curse and the day of resurrection ۗ unless they return their Lord ۗ No dimension
11|61|And to the thorns of their brother righteously ۚ He said, O people ۚ My Lord is a close closeness
11|62|They said, O righteousness, you were in us before this.
11|63|He said, O people, you saw that if I was on a softer from my Lord, and I have come from him as a mercy, so whoever makes me victorious from God, if he disobeyed me, then he will be lost.
11|64|And the people of this is the camel of God for you, for you, so you will eat it in the land of God, and do not touch it with worsen
11|65|So they said, and they said, so they enjoyed in your house three days.
11|66|When our command came, we saved us righteous, and those who believed with him with mercy from us and from the treachery of the day
11|67|And those who wronged the swallow took, and they became in their house.
11|68|As if they did not sing in it ۗ unless they disbelieve their Lord ۗ No dimension
11|69|And our messengers came to Abraham in the Bashir, they said, peace be upon him.
11|70|When he saw their hands, they will not reach them, and they are happy with them.
11|71|And his woman is a standing upright, and she laughed, and we preached it to Isaac, and from the success of Isaac Jacob
11|72|She said, O my dear
11|73|They said: Do you like the command of God.
11|74|When he went away from Abraham, the horror came to him, and the human being came to us in the people of Lot.
11|75|Abraham is a hypocrisy
11|76|O Abraham, I will be exposed to this ۖ He has come to the command of your Lord.
11|77|And when our messengers came, they were bad for them, and they were sacrificed to them, and he said this is a norm.
11|78|And his people, his people, are harassing him, and before they were doing the bad things ۚ He said, O people Are you not a Rashid man
11|79|They said that you have learned what we have in your daughters of the right, and you will not know what we want
11|80|He said if I have a powerful or an eye on you.
11|81|They said, O Lot, we are the messengers of your Lord, and they will not reach you. They promised them the morning?
11|82|When our command came, we made it a high
11|83|Sweetened with your Lord ۖ and what is from the oppressors after
11|84|And to the two sons of their brother, he said: O people A torture of a surrounding day
11|85|And the people of the Mecal and the Mazan in the installment.
11|86|God remained better for you if you are believers ۚ and what I have to do with a memorization
11|87|They said, O Shaab, your prayers, your command is to leave what worships our parents, or that we do in our hopes of what we have, but you are the righteous.
11|88|He said, O people What I have been able to do ۚ and what you fulfill except with God ۚ upon him I have been reluctant and to Him
11|89|O people, I will not criminalize you, my struggle is that you will afflict you like the people of Noah, or the people of Hood, or the people of the righteousness of the
11|90|And ask forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to him ۚ My Lord is merciful and bodies
11|91|They said, O Shaab, what we have agreed with many of what you say, and we will see you in weakness.
11|92|He said, O people, I will give you my best from God, and you will take Him and behind you.
11|93|O people, do your place that I am a worker 😂 Suffice you know whoever comes to torment that he shares and who is a liar and a liar.
11|94|And when our command came, we saved people and those who believed with him with mercy from us, and I took those who wronged the shout
11|95|As if they did not sing in it ۗ No distance to Midin, as you have diminished
11|96|Moses has sent us with our verses and sultanate.
11|97|To Pharaoh and his fullness, then follow the command of Pharaoh.
11|98|He presents his people on the Day
11|99|And follow in this curse and the day of resurrection ۚ The misery
11|100|That is from the prophets of the villages.
11|101|And we did not oppress them, but they wronged themselves.
11|102|Likewise, I take your Lord when he takes the villages and it is the unjust ۚ He takes it as a hard
11|103|In that is a woman who is afraid of the torment of the hereafter ۚ That is a whole day
11|104|And what we delay it except for the sake of the number
11|105|A day comes, you do not speak to the same
11|106|As for those who have been in the fire, they have an exhalation and a martyr.
11|107|Creators in it as long as the heavens and the earth are as long as your Lord wills ۚ Your Lord is act
11|108|As for those who are happy in Paradise, they are immortal in it, as long as the heavens and the earth have been as long as your Lord wills.
11|109|Do not be in a bitterness from what worships these people ۚ What they worship except as they worship their parents before ۚ and they are not.
11|110|And Moses came to us, so he would have disagreed with it ۚ and if there was no word that preceded your Lord, he would have spent between them ۚ and they have a doubt
11|111|And that all of them will fulfill their Lord their deeds ۚ It is what they do expert

11|122|And wait for us to wait
11|123|And to God, the absence of the heavens and the earth, and to Him, all the command will be returned, so worship him and trust in him
12|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
12|2|We have sent it an Arabic Qur’an, so that you may be reasonable.
12|3|We tell you the best of the story
12|4|When Joseph said to his father, O Father, I saw one of the ten khbat, sun, and the moon, I saw them as prostrating to me.

12|7|It was in Yusuf and his brothers verses for the families
12|8|When they said, “Yusuf and his brother loved to our father from us and we are nervous that our father has a clear delusion

12|16|And their father came to be crying
12|17|They said, O our father, that we are gone, and we have left us, and we have been cursed with us.
12|18|And they came to his vastness with false blood.
12|19|A car came, so they sent and wanted them, so I will give it to its sins.
12|20|And they spread it with a precious one, and they were numerous and they were in it.
12|21|And he said, who was bought by Egypt, to his wife, my honor, and he will be blessed. And the night of the hadiths ۚ and God is overwhelmed by his command, but the most people do not know
12|22|And when he reached the most intense, we gave him judgment and knowledge.

18|2|A valuable to warn with a severe misery of his religion and preach the believers who do righteousness that they have a good reward
18|3|They are ever
18|4|And those who said, God will take a father
18|5|What they have of knowledge, nor their parents ۚ I have grown up a word that comes out of their mouths ۚ They say only a lie
18|6|Perhaps your soul is on their effects, if they do not believe in this hadith, sorry

18|8|And we are making what they have to be happy.
18|9|Or did you think that the owners of the gay and the sophistication were wondering from our signs.
18|10|When the fatwa was to the gay, then they said, our Lord, we have come from you, mercy, and it is for us from our command as a guide.
18|11|So we were struck by their ears in the age of two years
18|12|Then we sent them to know which parties are counted for what they have come to.
18|13|We tell you their news with the truth ۚ They are a girl who believed in their Lord and increased them
18|14|And we were attached to their hearts when they rose up, so they said, Lord, Lord of the heavens, and the earth, and we will not call from it without it.
18|15|These people have taken from him without the gods, if only they would not come to them with a clear authority.
18|16|And when you disgrace them and what they worship except God, then return to the fear, spread to you your Lord from his mercy
18|17|And you see the sun when you are coming out, and they will be overwhelmed He is the guidance ۖ and whoever is misled, you will not find a guided guardian for him
18|18|And they calculate them, they are awake and they are steadfastly ۚ and we turn them with the same days and the Shamal’s deeds. Well and filled with them
18|19|Likewise, we sent them to ask them to ask them to do so. You will be with you to the city to the city, so let him see the best food, so let you come to you with a liveli
18|20|If they appear to you, they will bring you or return you in their mill
18|21|Likewise, we have stumbled upon them to know that God promises a truth, and that the hour is not a doubt about it. I knew about them ۚ He said those who dominated their affairs, so that we can take them as a mosque
18|22|They will say three of them, their lords, and they will say five, their sixth, their dogs are shameful with the unseen. What they know is nothing but a few ۗ, so do not go through them except for a phenomenon, and you will not be satisfied with them from them
18|23|And do not say anything that I am doing that tomorrow
18|24|Except that God wills ۚ and mention your Lord if you forget and say, may God guide me to my Lord, to come close to this
18|25|And they found in their cave three hundred years and increased nine.
18|26|Say God, know what they have come to, ۖ He has the absence of heavens and the earth.
18|27|And what is revealed to you from the writers of your Lord ۖ There is no substitute for his words, and you will not find it without it.
18|28|And be patient with those who invite their Lord with lunch and east, they want their faces. His heart from our remembrance and follow his whim
18|29|Say the truth from your Lord ۖ Whoever wants, let him believe, and whoever wills, let him be atoned. Like the people, the faces of the faces ۚ the misery of the drink and the abuse of the
18|30|Those who believe and do righteous deeds, but we do not waste the reward of those who are good.
18|31|Those are the gardens of an adult that runs from the rivers of them To your opinions ۚ Yes, the garment
18|32|And they have two men who made us one of them, two of them are two gravies, and we have exhausted them with a breach and made them between them.
18|33|The two gardens were eaten, and she did not oppress anything from him.
18|34|And he had a fruit, so he said to his companion, and he was paving it, I am more than you
18|35|He entered his paradise while he was the oppressor of himself
18|36|And I do not think the hour is standing, and if I turn to my Lord, I would find good from it.
18|37|His friend said to him, and he was inserting him.
18|38|But he is God, my Lord, and I do not share my Lord
18|39|And if only if you entered your paradise, you will say what God has wished, there is no power except with God ۚ If you think that I am less than you and a child
18|40|So my Lord is good for you to give a good one of your paradise and send them a heart of the sky, so it would be sworn in a shock
18|41|Or it becomes a wateer, you will not be able to seek a request.
18|42|And he was surrounded by his fruit, and he would turn his sufficiency to what he agreed with, and it is a khulah on her veins, and he said: “Oh, whoever is,”
18|43|And there was no group that they would support him without God, and what was victorious
18|44|There is the state the right to Allah is the best reward and the best decades that followed
18|45|And they have the same as the worldly life, as we descended from the sky, so the prophecies of the earth were mixed with it, so the wilderness of the earth was confused with it R
18|46|Money and sons are the adornment of this worldly life.
18|47|On the day we forget the mountains and see the land with a prominent and we greeted them, so we did not leave anyone from them
18|48|And expose your Lord to a class, as you have come as we created you first time ۚ Rather, you claimed, but we will make you a blessing for you
18|49|And the book is placed, and you see the criminals who are separated from what is in it and they say, O, and we are the money of this book. What do they do are present ۗ and your Lord does not oppress anyone
18|50|And when we said to the angels, they would find the Adam, so they would be prostrated except for the sake of the jinn. You have an enemy.
18|51|What I witnessed the creation of the heavens and the earth, and did not create themselves, and what I was taking the struggle as a member
18|52|On the day, they say that they called my partners who claimed, so they called them, and they did not respond to them and made us between them
18|53|And the criminals saw the fire, and they thought that they were falling it and they did not find it as a behavior.
18|54|And we have shown in this Qur’an for people from every example ۚ and man was the most severe thing
18|55|And what people are forbidden to believe when the guidance came to them, and they seek forgiveness from their Lord, except that the Sunnah of the first will come
18|56|And we do not send the messengers except those who are good A
18|57|And whoever is hurt by those who are mentioned by the verses of his Lord, he will be exposed to them and forgot what he presented. If you call them to the guidance, they will never be guided
18|58|And your Lord, the forgiveness, is the mercy.
18|59|And those villages, our people, when they did wrong, and made us for their humiliation
18|60|And when Moses said that he would not be happy until I reach the whole of the two sea or the righteousness
18|61|فَلَمَّا بَلَغَا مَجْمَعَ بَيْنِهِمَا نَسِيَا حُوتَهُمَا فَاتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي الْبَحْرِ سَرَبًا
18|62|"When he came, he said, ""We gave us a lunch, because we have come from our travels."
18|63|He said that you have seen when we were to the rock, because I forgot the voice and what I forget except for the Satan to remind it ۚ and take it to the sacrifice.
18|64|He said that what we were glorified ۚ and they were struggled with their effects.
18|65|So they found a servant of our worshipers.
18|66|Moses said to him: Do I follow you to know what you have learned as a guide?
18|67|He said that you will not be able to be patient
18|68|And how do you think about what you did not degrade.
18|69|He said: You will find me if God will be patient, and I will not disobey you.
18|70|He said that if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I am talking to you from it.
18|71|So they released even when they installed in the travel, they were burned.
18|72|He said: Did you not say that you will not be able to be patient.
18|73|"He said, ""Do not take me as I forgot, and do not give me a hardship from my matter."""
18|74|So they went until when he was gone, then he killed him, he said, you killed a soul that is zakat with a soul, you have come to something
18|75|He said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to be patient with patience.
18|76|He said that if I asked you about something after it, do not accompany me.
18|77|So they are released until they came to the people of a village. You took a reward for it
18|78|He said this is a difference between me and you ۚ I will tell you that you will not be able to be patient with patience
18|79|As for travel, it was for two sites working in the sea, so I wanted to defect it, and their successes were a king who takes all the sins
18|80|As for the crime, his parents were believers.
18|81|So we wanted to replace them with their Lord, good than him, zakat and close mercy
18|82|As for the grandmother, it was for two people in the city, and it was a treasure for them, and their father was righteous. A from your Lord ۚ and what I did from my command ۚ That is the interpretation of what you did not have to be patient
18|83|And they ask you about the two of the two centuries.
18|84|We enabled him in the land and brought him from everything because
18|85|So he followed a reason
18|86|Until the ritual of the sun reached, it will be strange in the eyes of the sun, and it is found for them. Good
18|87|He said: As for whoever wronged, we will be tormented, then he returns to his Lord, and he will torment him with torment
18|88|As for those who believe and do righteousness, he has the reward of goodness ^ And we will say to him from our command to be pleased
18|89|Then follow a reason
18|90|Until, when he reaches the lord of the sun and found it, it will come to the people, and we did not make them without them
18|91|As you have been informed of what he had experienced
18|92|Then follow a reason
18|93|Until, when he reached between the two sides, he found from them a people, they would not have almost agreed
18|94|They said: “This is the two parties, if it is brought and wounded in the land, so do we make you a way out for you to make them and make them clear
18|95|He said what I have been in my Lord is better, so they help me with a powerful force, and I will make between you and them as a number of them
18|96|The Zabr al -Hadidi came to me until it was between the two friends, he said: “So that they would be blown up.”
18|97|فَمَا اسْطَاعُوا أَنْ يَظْهَرُوهُ وَمَا اسْتَطَاعُوا لَهُ نَقْبًا
18|98|He said this is a mercy from my Lord.
18|99|And we left some of them, then they waved in each other.
18|100|We have been present to Hell, then for the disbelievers, as a result.
18|101|Those who were appointed in a cover from my remembrance and they were not recovering
18|102|I calculate those who disbelieved to take my servants from my guardians.
18|103|Say: Do we tell you about the losers?
18|104|Those who have gone astray in this worldly life, and they calculate that they are good.
18|105|Those who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and to meet him, so their deeds were loved, so we do not reside for them on the Day of Resurrection and Zenin
18|106|That is their hell, with what they disbelieved and took my signs and my messengers shake
18|107|Those who believed and doing righteous deeds had the paradise of the paradise.
18|108|They are immortal in it, and they do not want it to be around
18|109|Say, if the sea was a penetration of the words of my Lord, we would run out of the sea before the words of my Lord will run out, and if we have come to the same
18|110|Say: I am a human being like you D.
19|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
19|2|Remember your Lord, your servant, Zakaria
19|3|When his Lord called a hidden call
19|4|My Lord said that I am the great of me, and the head was a young man, and I was not your prayers, Lord
19|5|And I have hidden the loyalty of my loyalty, and my wife was barren, so he gave me to you and my loyalty
19|6|He inherits me and inherits from the family of Jacob.
19|7|O Zakaria, we preach to you with a height of his name.
19|8|My Lord said that I would have a glory, and my wife was barren, and I have reached the oldest
19|9|He said that your Lord said that he is on me.
19|10|He said, Lord, make me a sign.
19|11|So his people came out of the warehous
19|12|Oh, greet the book with a powerful person.
19|13|And hennted from our religion and zakat ۖ and it was featured
19|14|And in his parents, he was not a disobedient mighty
19|15|And peace be upon him on the day of a child and the day he dies and the day he will send a neighborhood
19|16|And mention in the book Mary, when she was rejected by her family
19|17|So I took from them without a veil, so we sent us to our souls, so she represented it as a successful human
19|18|She said that I seek refuge in mercy from you.
19|19|He said: I am the Messenger
19|20|She said that I have a cloud, and I did not touch me, and I was not a prostitute.
19|21|"He said, ""Your Lord said,"" It is on me with a time. """
19|22|She carried him, and she was rejected by a short place
19|23|So the frightening came to her to the trunk of the palm tree.
19|24|So he called her from her
19|25|And shake to you with the trunk of the palm tree, you will fall on you a wet.
19|26|So, my entire, and I will read a eyes.
19|27|So her people came to him, you can carry it. They said, Mary,
19|28|O sister of Harun, what your father was a woman and what your mother was abolished
19|29|So I referred to him 😂 They said, How can we speak to those who were in the Mahdi boy
19|30|He said that I was the servant of God
19|31|And made me a blessing wherever I was and I was blessed with prayers and zakat as long as I live
19|32|And in my mother, he did not make me a hard mighty.
19|33|And peace be upon me on the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I send a neighborhood
19|34|That is the son of Mary ۚ The saying of the truth in which they are passed
19|35|It would not have been taken from a child 😂 Glory be to Him ۚ If he spent an order, then he says to him, be it
19|36|And God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him ۚ This is a straight path
19|37|The parties differed from among them 😂 Fawal to those who disbelieved from a great day
19|38|I hear about them and see the day they come
19|39|And warn them on the day of the misfortune, when the matter was spent, and they are in a negligence, and they do not believe in
19|40|We inherit the earth and those who are on it, and to us they will return
19|41|And mention in the book Abraham ۚ He was a friend of a prophet
19|42|When he said to his father, O father, why do you worship what he does not hear, does not see, nor does he sing anything from you
19|43|O father, I have come to me from the knowledge that you did not come, so I will bring me up to your guidance.
19|44|O father, do not worship the Satan.
19|45|O father, I am afraid that you will be a torment
19|46|He said, I want you from my family, O Abraham.
19|47|Peace be upon you said: My Lord will forgive you.
19|48|And I will dismiss you and what you call from God and I pray my Lord, may I not be the prayers of my Lord as hard
19|49|When they disobeyed them, and what they worshiped without God, and we have been given to him and Jacob ۖ and all of us made a prophet
19|50|And we gave them from our mercy and made us a righteous tongue on them
19|51|And remember in the book Moses ۚ He was a savvy and a prophet was a prophet
19|52|And we called it from the side of the right phase, and we raised it.
19|53|And we gave him from our mercy, his brother, Harun, a prophet.
19|54|And remember in the book I hear ۚ He was the one who was considered a promise and a messenger was a prophet.
19|55|And his family was commanded to pray
19|56|And mention in the book Edris ۚ He was a friend of a prophet
19|57|We raised it as a place
19|58|Those who have been blessed by God from the offspring of Adam, and whoever carried us with Noah and from the offspring of Abraham If the verses of the Most Merciful are followed by them, they are miserable and crying.
19|59|So he succeeded after them, they lost the prayers and followed the lusts.
19|60|Except for those who repent, believe and do righteousness, then those who enter Paradise and do not oppress anything
19|61|The gardens of Aden who promised the mercy of his servants with the unseen ۚ He was coming out
19|62|They do not hear in it, except peace.
19|63|That paradise that we inherit from our worshipers who were feared
19|64|And we do not descend except with the command of your Lord ۖ He has what is between our hands, and what is left of us, and what is between you ۚ and what your Lord was forgotten
19|65|Lord of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them, then worship him and be patient for his worshipers ۚ Do you know him with the heavens
19|66|And man says that when you have come, there is no life.
19|67|The human being is not a person who created it from before, and nothing is something
19|68|So your confusion, we will be gathered and the participants, and then we bring them around Hell.
19|69|Then let us remove from every Shiite, which is the most accurate of mercy
19|70|Then, let us know who are the ones who are praying with it.
19|71|And if you only want it ۚ He was on your Lord, a judge.
19|72|Then we save those who fear and warn the oppressors in it.
19|73|And when our verses are shown on them, the evidence of those who disbelieved to those who believe in any of the two parties are good, and good and good.
19|74|And how many of us are before them from a century, they are the best furniture.
19|75|Say: Whoever is in the misfortune, let the mercy be for him. Sorry a soldier
19|76|And God who guided them increases and the righteous rest is good for your Lord, a garment and a good way
19|77|Did you see the one who disbelieved in our verses and said: I will not be a child and a son
19|78|He looked at the unseen, or he was taken with mercy as a covenant
19|79|No ۚ We will write what he says and extends to him from the torment as a period
19|80|And we inherit it what he says, and we come to an individual
19|81|And take from God the gods to be proud of them
19|82|Both Sikvron Babadthm and they are in opposition
19|83|Did you not see that we sent the devils on the disbelievers
19|84|Do not hurry upon them.
19|85|On the day we gather the righteous to the Most Merciful
19|86|And the markets of the criminals to Hell and a response
19|87|They do not have intercession except for those who are taken with mercy as a covenant
19|88|And they said that the mercy took
19|89|You have come
19|90|The heavens almost break the fast from it, breathe
19|91|They called for the Most Merciful
19|92|And what he is for the mercy is that he takes a child
19|93|For everyone in the heavens and the earth except for the mercy of the servant
19|94|I have counted them and promised them as an enemy
19|95|And all of them come to the Day of Resurrection
19|96|Those who believe and do righteous deeds will make them the mercy of them.
19|97|So we are pleased with your tongue to preach the righteous and the people who are blessed with it
19|98|And how many of us are before them from a century?
20|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Taha
20|2|The Qur’an has not revealed to you
20|3|It is a reminder to who awes
20|4|A download from the creation of the earth and the high heavens
20|5|the most merciful sat on his throne
20|6|He has what is in the heavens, what is on the earth, and what is between them, and what is under the richness
20|7|But it makes no secret of saying it knows the secret and hidden
20|8|God is no god but He 😂 He has the good names
20|9|Is Moses's hadith brought you?
20|10|When he saw a fire, he said to his family, so that I would forget a fire, so that I may come to you from it with tribes or find this for the fire.
20|11|When she came to her, Moses
20|12|I am your Lord, so make up for you.
20|13|And I chose you, so he listens to what is revealed
20|14|I am God, there is no god but I, worship me and make prayer for my remembrance
20|15|The hour is that I almost hide it to reward every soul with what it seeks
20|16|Do not believe you from those who do not believe in it and follow his whim
20|17|And what is in your mind, Moses
20|18|He said that she is my stick, I grabbed it and I am surprised by it on my sheep, and I have another
20|19|"He said, ""Moses"
20|20|So he gave it to her, so if it is alive, she seeks
20|21|Take it, and do not be afraid.
20|22|And you will come to your wing, bring out a whiteness from other bad times.
20|23|To show you from our great signs
20|24|He went to Pharaoh, he is overwhelmed
20|25|My Lord said, I explain to me my chest
20|26|And it is easy for me
20|27|And a decade from Sani
20|28|They agree with me
20|29|And make a minister from my family
20|30|Harun my brother
20|31|I am stressing it
20|32|And share it in my command
20|33|In order to praise you a lot
20|34|We remind you many
20|35|You were a vision
20|36|"You have said, ""Moses"
20|37|And we have again
20|38|When we have revealed to your mother what is revealed
20|39|That I eliminate it in the coffin, and take it out in the day, let him throw it up with the witch My
20|40|When your sister walks, then you will say that I will show you to those who guarantee him? You are dead ۚ So you have seen two years in the people
20|41|And I broke your soul
20|42|You and your brother are guessing with my revelations, and you are not in my remembrance
20|43|He went to Pharaoh, he was overwhelmed
20|44|So say to him a soft saying that he may remember or fear
20|45|"We said, ""We are afraid to excess of us or to be overwhelmed"
20|46|"He said, ""Do not be afraid?"""
20|47|So he came to him, and we say: “A messenger, your Lord, will send us with the children of Israel, and do not torture them.”
20|48|We have revealed to us that the torment is on the one who lied and tied up.
20|49|He said: Who is your Lord, Moses
20|50|Our Lord, who gave everything that he created, then guided
20|51|He said: No, the first centuries
20|52|Her knowledge said when my Lord is in a book.
20|53|The one who made the earth to you is a paved, and you have a way for you and the heavens of the sky with water, so we brought it out of the wives
20|54|Eat and raise your blessing ۗ, for that there are signs for the first of the end.
20|55|From them we created you, and for them, we will bring you back, and from them we bring you another time
20|56|And we have given him all our signs, so he lied and doors
20|57|He said: We have come to come out of our satisfaction with Mossa, Moses
20|58|Let us bring you a magic like it, so make between us and between you a bum that we do not succeed.
20|59|He said your bid.
20|60|He took care of Pharaoh, so he gathered his friend and then came
20|61|Moses said to them, and you will not be fascinated by God as a lie, so you will be forgiven with torture.
20|62|So they are disputed
20|63|They said that these are an enchanting, they want to come out of your land with their warmth and what you want with your way of your likeness
20|64|So they gathered your friend, then come in a class.
20|65|They said, Moses, either to be met, or to be the first of those who met.
20|66|He said: Rather, they will be thrown.
20|67|Voojs at the same wary Moses
20|68|Say: Do not be afraid that you are the highest
20|69|And throw what is in your right
20|70|So the magic dubbed a prostration, and they said: We believed in the Lord of Harun and Moses.
20|71|He said to him before I have been ears for you. And you know where we are more tormented and remained
20|72|They said we will not affect you from what we have come from the evidence and the one who broke our fast.
20|73|We believed in our Lord to forgive us, our sins, and what we have made of us from magic
20|74|He who comes to his Lord is a crime, for he has hell, and he does not die in it or revives
20|75|And whoever comes to him is a believer who has done righteousness, for those who have the highest perpetrators.
20|76|The gardens of Aden running from under which the rivers are immortal in it.
20|77|And we have indicated to Moses to be pleased with my servants, and he will be guided by a way in the sea dressed, not to be afraid of a blessing, and do not fear
20|78|So Faren followed them with his soldiers, and he cheated them from the day.
20|79|Farn was misled by his people, and what was guided
20|80|O sons of secrets, we have saved you from your enemy, and we are our backs on the side
20|81|Eat from the goodness of what we have given you, and do not overwhelm it, and my anger will be upon you.
20|82|And I am forgiven for those who repent, believe and do righteousness, then guide me
20|83|And I do not hurry you from your people, Moses
20|84|They said they are proud of my influence, and I hurried to you, Lord, to be pleased with you
20|85|He said: We have missed your people after you and the Samaritan misleading them
20|86|Moses returned to his people, Ghoban, sorry. What did you go?
20|87|They said: We did not leave your baptism with our angel, but we have carried out a visit from the adornment of the people, so we threw it, so you will be blessed.
20|88|So he brought them a hurry to them with the treasures of it, so they said this is your God, and God is Moses and forgot
20|89|Do you not see that they do not return to them a saying, nor do they have harm or benefit
20|90|And Haroun said to them before, O people
20|91|They said that we will not be happy with him until Moses will return to us.
20|92|He said, O Haroun, what prevented you when you saw them
20|93|Do you not follow?
20|94|He said, O son of a mother
20|95|He said: What do you think of you, Samarri
20|96|He said, I did not see what they had not seen, and I fell in the arrest of the influence of the Messenger, so I rejected it, and as well
20|97|He said, go, for you are in life, to say that there is no basis. Let us blow it up in the day, sorry
20|98|But God, God, who is no god but He ۚ and the expansion of everything with knowledge
20|99|We have been short of you from the prophets of what has been before
20|100|Whoever offers to it, then he carries the day of resurrection
20|101|Creators in it 😂 and worse for them on the Day of Resurrection
20|102|The day is breathed into the images ۚ and we are governing the criminals on the day
20|103|You are afraid of them if you are only ten
20|104|We know what they say when he says, I like them as a way if you are only one day
20|105|And they ask you about the mountains, so say, my Lord, my Lord, sorry
20|106|So it will be shrouded in a class
20|107|Do not see it in it, nor a nation
20|108|Then they follow the preacher, and I have no shelter.
20|109|Then the intercession does not benefit except for those who have mercy on him and the satisfaction of him saying
20|110|He knows what is between their hands and what they left and do not surround it with knowledge
20|111|And she cursed the faces of the living neighborhood ۖ and whoever carried injustice was disappointed
20|112|And whoever works from the righteous and is a believer, he does not fear injustice, nor does he digest
20|113|Likewise, we have sent it an Arabic Quran and we have displaced in it from the return, so that they may fear or speak to them.
20|114|So God Almighty is the right to the right, and do not hurry with the Qur’an before you will be destroyed to you and his life.
20|115|And we have covented us to Adam before we forgot, and we did not find it with me
20|116|And when we said to the angels, they found for the Adam, so they found only the father of my father
20|117|So we said, Adam, that this is an enemy for you and your husband, so do not leave you from Heaven, so you will be granted
20|118|It is for you that there is no hunger in it or nudity
20|119|And you do not fill it in it and do not sacrifice
20|120|So the Satan of Satan said, O Adam, do I show you on the tree of immortality and a king who does not come to me
20|121|So they eaten from them, and they appeared to them and they were separated from them.
20|122|Then his Lord answered him, and he repented to him and guided
20|123|He said all of them are all of them 😂
20|124|And whoever displays my remembrance, then he has a livelihood, and we will be governed by the Day of Resurrection
20|125|My Lord said: “Why did you insult me ​​blind?
20|126|Our signs are faced Vnciha as well as a memorable day also he said
20|127|Likewise, we are rewarded for those who are pleased and did not believe in the verses of his Lord ۚ and the torment of the hereafter is more severe and remained
20|128|Did he not guide them as we have before them from the centuries who walk in their dwellings
20|129|And had it not been for a word that preceded your Lord
20|130|So be patient with what they say and praise the praise of your Lord before the sun was brought up and before its stagnates 😂 and from the end of the night, then the night of the night, and it is the same
20|131|And your eyes do not extend to what we have enjoyed with the wives of them, the flower of life of this world
20|132|And command your family to pray and be patient with it ۖ We do not ask you for a liveli
20|133|"And they said, ""If not for us to come from a verse of his Lord, do you not come to them between what is in the first newspapers"
20|134|And if I had a torment of them before him, they would not have said: Were it not for us, you would not send us a messenger, then you will follow your signs of the rituals
20|135|Say every confusion, and they are pursued.
21|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
21|2|What comes to them is a male of their Lord
21|3|They have their hearts ۗ and brought the survivors who have been wronged.
21|4|My Lord, he knows the saying in the sky and the earth.
21|5|Rather, they said the clumps
21|6|What you believed before them from a village that we are.
21|7|And we have not sent before you, except for men.
21|8|And we did not make them a body, they do not eat food, and they were immortal.
21|9|Then we believed them, so we saved them, and whoever you want, and the people of us are the ones.
21|10|We have revealed to you a book in which your remembrance is?
21|11|And we were divided from a village that was unjust and we created after it, another people
21|12|When they felt, when they were from them, they will be one of them.
21|13|Do not be running and go back to what you have been in it and your dwellings, so that you may be asked
21|14|They said, “We are the oppressors
21|15|So what they called them, so they called them until we made them a good harvest.
21|16|And we did not create the sky and the earth, and what is between them.
21|17|If we wanted to take a fun, we would not take it from our religion, if we are active
21|18|Rather, we take the right to false
21|19|And he has those in the heavens and the earth ۚ and whoever has it, they are not arrogant about his worshipers, nor do they not be able
21|20|They praise the night and the day, they do not break
21|21|Or they took the gods from the earth, they are published
21|22|If there were gods except God, they would spoil ۚ So, God bless the Lord of the throne, what they describe
21|23|He does not ask what he does and they are asked
21|24|Or did they take from the gods of the gods?
21|25|And what we have sent before you from a messenger, except that we have revealed to him that there is no god but I, so worship
21|26|And they said that the mercy took a son ۗ Glory
21|27|They do not precede him by saying, and they are doing it.
21|28|He knows what is between their hands and what they succeeded, and they do not interfere except for those who are satisfied with them, and they are their fear.
21|29|And whoever says from them is that God is without him
21|30|Wasn't those who disbelieved that the heavens and the earth were rushing, and we were buried, and we made them from the water.
21|31|And we made in the land to the earth, to extend them with them, and made us in it as a way
21|32|And we made the sky a futile stance.
21|33|He is the one who created the night, the day, the sun, and the moon.
21|34|And we did not make a good time before you.
21|35|Every soul is the taste of death ۗ and we are blessed with evil and goodness.
21|36|And if those who disbelieve see you, if they take you except for a shake, this is the one who remembers your gods, and they are the most merciful.
21|37|A man was created from a hurry ۚ I will show you my signs, so do not hurry
21|38|And they say when this is a promise if you are true
21|39|If those who disbelieve know when they are not enough for their faces, the fire is not for their appearance
21|40|Rather, you will come to them, so you will be happy, so they will not seek their response, and they are not looking
21|41|And I was mocked by messengers before you, and they were joined by those who were ridiculed of them what they were mocking
21|42|Say: Whoever takes you at night and the day from the mercy
21|43|Or do they have gods who prevent them from our without us ۚ They do not seek help from themselves
21|44|Rather, we used to be the ones and their fathers until the life has overlooking them ۗ So do you not see that we come to the land, we will decrease it
21|45|Say: I will not warn you of the revelation ۚ and the deaf does not hear the supplication when they are warned
21|46|And if they are entertained by the torment of your Lord, they will say, O, and we are the oppressors
21|47|And we are placed in the middle of the resurrection on the Day of Resurrection, so there is nothing wrong with anything.
21|48|And Moses and the people of the parties came to us and a masculine of the righteous.
21|49|Those who fear their Lord with the unseen, and they are the clock.
21|50|And this is a blessed male, we have come down to him ۚ Did you deny it to him
21|51|Abraham came to us from before, and we were with two scientists
21|52|When he said to his father and his people, what is the converge
21|53|They said and found our fathers to her worshipers
21|54|He said that you and your parents were in a clear delusion
21|55|They said: You have come to us, or you are among the players
21|56|He said, but your Lord, the Lord
21|57|And God, for you to make sure that you are in the hands of
21|58|So he made them attractive except for them, so that they may return
21|59|They said: Who did this with our gods, for those who are unjust
21|60|They said: We heard us, so they remember them, Abraham said to him
21|61|They said they brought him to people's eyes that they may testify
21|62|Are you saying you did this Balehtna O Ibrahim
21|63|But they do advantaged this Vasolohm said that they speak
21|64|They returned to themselves, they said, is you the wrong-doers
21|65|Then we were on their heads, you have learned what they are
21|66|"He said, ""They worshiped from God without nothing, nor will it harm you"
21|67|I am for you and for what you worship without God?
21|68|They said they burned and supported your gods if you are active.
21|69|"We said, ""Fire, be a cold and peace on Abraham"
21|70|And they wanted it as a good, so we made them lost.
21|71|We saved him and despair to the land in which we have been blessed with the worlds
21|72|And we gave him Isaac and Jacob Nafilan ۖ and all of us made righteousness
21|73|And we made them imams guiding our affairs, and we have revealed them to them, the deeds of goodness, the establishment of prayer, and the payment of the zakat, and they are the ones.
21|74|And in terms of wisdom and knowledge, we saved him from the village that was doing hidden things ۗ They were the people of the bad.
21|75|And we entered it in our mercy.
21|76|And it is when he called from before, then we answered him, so we saved him and his family from the great Lord
21|77|And we insisted on it from the people who lied to our verses ۚ They were the people of goodness, so we immersed them together
21|78|And Dawood and Solomon, when they are judged in the plow, when I spread in it the sheep of the people, and we were for their rule
21|79|So we understood it, Solomon ۚ and all of us are judgment and knowledge.
21|80|And we taught him a labia maker for you to protect you from your horses?
21|81|And for the two scents, it is described by his command to the land in which we have been blessed in it ۚ and we were everything
21|82|And among the devils are those who divide him and do action without that.
21|83|And Iboub, when his Lord called on me, I am the harm of the harm.
21|84|So we answered him, and we revealed what he has from the harm.
21|85|And the hearing, and Edris, and the guarantee ۖ each of the patients
21|86|And we entered them in our mercy.
21|87|So the noun, when he went angry, thought that we would not be able to do it, and he called in the darkness that there is no god but you, but you are from you
21|88|and to him we resoponded and saved from the burden and so we save the believers
21|89|And Zakari, when his Lord called, Lord, do not give me an individual, and you are the best of the inheritors
21|90|So we answered him and gave us a greeting, and we have his husbands ۚ ۚ They were rushing in the goodness, and they will be called.
21|91|And the one who fortified her hope, so we have breathed into it from our souls and made it and its son a sign for the two worlds
21|92|This is your nation as one nation, and I am your Lord, so worship
21|93|And they cut their command between them 😂 All to us will return
21|94|Whoever works from the righteous, who is a believer, has no disbelievers for his pursuit, and we have two writers
21|95|And forbidden to a village that we destroyed that they are not returning
21|96|Until, if it is made, they are brought and a javer
21|97|And the promise is close to the truth, so if it is a luxurious, the eyes of those who disbelieved, O, and we have been in a neglect of this, but it is not.
21|98|You and what you worship without God, you will be hell.
21|99|If these gods what Rduha and all will abide therein
21|100|They have an exhalation, and they do not hear

21|102|They do not hear her sensation ۖ and they are in what their souls are uncomfortable
21|103|The great fear does not grieve them and the angels will receive them
21|104|The day of the sky is like a record of the record for the book ۚ As we started the first creation of his return ۚ and promise to us ۚ I was so
21|105|And we have written in the zipper after the remembrance that the earth is inherited by my good servants
21|106|In this, in the case of the people of worshipers
21|107|And we have only sent you a mercy to the worlds

22|6|That is that God is the truth, and that it revives the dead, and that it is for everything.
22|7|And that the hour is coming, there is no doubt in it, and that God sends those in the graves
22|8|And among the people who argue with God, without knowledge, no guidance, nor a brief book

22|17|Those who believed, those who have guided, and those who are guilty, and the Christians, and those who have participated, and those who have been blessed, for God separates them from the day of the day.
22|18|Did you not see that God is prostrating to him who is in the heavens and from the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountain Weld ۗ and whoever insults God, then he has no honorable ۚ God does what He wills ۩
22|19|These are two characteristics, who were silent in their Lord 😭 So those who disbelieved were cut off for them, garments of fire that poured out from the heads of their heads.

23|13|Then We made the sperm in McCain's decision
23|14|Then we created the sperm with a relationship, so we created the relationship with chewing, so we created the chew The best of the creators
23|15|Then you are after that
23|16|Then you are the Day of Resurrection

23|21|And for you in the pour of a lesson in a lesson.
23|22|And on it, and on the ark, they can bear
23|23|We have sent Noah to his people, and he said: O people, worship God, what you have from God other than him.
23|24|So he said the pain who disbelieved from his people, but this is only a human being, like you We are the first two
23|25|If he is only a man with a paradise, then they will be luked with it until when

23|28|If you are equal to you and whoever is with you on the ark, then say praise be to God who brought us from the unjust people
23|29|Say, Lord, give me a blessed descendant, and you are the best of the two.
23|30|In that, there are signs, and if we are fool

23|42|Then we were established after them.
23|43|What is preceded by a nation that is for her and what they are delayed
23|44|Then we sent our messengers to see 😂 All of what a nation came to her.
23|45|Then we sent us Moses and his brother, Harun, with our signs and sins.
23|46|To Pharaoh and Him, so they arrogated and they were a high people
23|47|So they said that I believe in two likes of us and their people for us.
23|48|So they lied to them, and they were from the people
23|49|Moses, the book, may come to us, may guide them
23|50|And we made the son of Mary and his mother a verse, and we have left them to the Lord with a decision
23|51|O messengers, they are both goods and do righteousness.
23|52|And this is your nation as one nation.
23|53|So they cut off their command between them as mob
23|54|So they lost them in their lunch until then
23|55|Do they calculate that we extend them with money and sons
23|56|We rushed to them in goodness ۚ Rather, they do not feel
23|57|Those who are from the fear of their Lord are accompanied
23|58|And those who are the verses of their Lord are believers
23|59|And those who are in their Lord are not involved
23|60|And those who come to what they have come and their hearts, and a way that they are to their Lord.
23|61|Those are rushed in goodness, and they have it.
23|62|And we do not cost a soul except its capacity.
23|63|Rather, their hearts are in a cloud of this, and they have deeds without that they have workers.
23|64|Even if we take them to the torment, if they are
23|65|Do not come today 😭 You are not victorious
23|66|My signs were followed by you, and you were on your punishment.
23|67|They arrogant with him a Samar who migrate
23|68|Did they not master the saying, or their parents have not come to the first two.
23|69|Or did they not know their Messenger, then they have denounced it
23|70|Or do they say a paradise with it ۚ but come to them with the truth and more for the truth
23|71|And if the truth followed their whims, the heavens and the earth would be spoiled and the earth, and those in them.
23|72|Or do you ask them a way out, and your Lord is good.
23|73|And you invite them to a straightforward path
23|74|And those who do not believe in the hereafter from the path to the people.
23|75|And if we have mercy on them and exposed them from their harm
23|76|And we took them with torment, so they did not accuse them of their Lord and what they were
23|77|Even if we open a door for them, with a severe torment, if they are in it.
23|78|And it is the one who created you with hearing, insight and hearts ۚ a little what you thank
23|79|And he is the one who has seen you in the land and to it is mourned
23|80|And he is the one who lives and dies, and he has dispersed the night and the day.
23|81|Rather, they said, like what the first said
23|82|They said when we died and you are dirty and great
23|83|We have prepared us and our parents before
23|84|Say for the earth and who is in it if you know
23|85|They will say to God Say Would not you remember
23|86|Say: Who is the Lord of the Seven Heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne
23|87|They will say to God ۚ Say: Do you not fear?
23|88|Say: Whoever is in his hand is the kingdom of everything
23|89|They will say to God ۚ Say: I am enlightened
23|90|Rather, they came to them with the truth, and they are liars
23|91|What God has taken from a child, and what was with him from God ۚ If all God gone gone with what was created, and perhaps some of them, some of them are the same.
23|92|The scientist of the unseen and testimony, so what they are involved
23|93|Say my Lord, or do you show me what they are promising
23|94|Lord, do not make me in the unjust people
23|95|And we should see what we promise for you to be able
23|96|Pay the best of the bad ۚ We know what they describe
23|97|Say, Lord, I seek refuge in you
23|98|And I seek refuge in you, Lord
23|99|Until, when one of them came death, the Lord said:
23|100|Perhaps I do righteousness in what I have left ۚ No ۚ It is a word that is its saying.
23|101|So if we are blown in pictures, then do not abandon them on the day and do not ask
23|102|So whoever is ahead of his mourners, then those are the ones.
23|103|And whoever has hidden his balances, those who have lost themselves in Hell are immortals
23|104|Their faces of the fire, and they are in it as the coffee
23|105|Will my signs be followed by you, and you were lying to you?
23|106|They said, our Lord
23|107|Our Lord is out of it.
23|108|They said, they are not in it and do not speak
23|109|It was a group of my servants, they say our Lord, we believed, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and you are the best of the Most Compassionate
23|110|So you took them ridiculous until I forget you, and you were laughing
23|111|The day they are today, with what they are patient.
23|112|He said how many years have you been in the land?
23|113|They said that we will stay on one day or some day, so ask the users.
23|114|He said that you only have a little.
23|115|Do you think that we created you in vain, and that you are not returned to us
23|116|So God Almighty is the truth.
23|117|And whoever calls with God to God is another, there is no shower for him, but his account is with his Lord ۚ He does not spoil the disbeliever
23|118|Say, Lord, forgive and be merciful, and you are the best of the merciful

24|2|The adulterer and the adulterers, so they can be done every one of them. They were tormented by a group of believers
24|3|The adulterer does not marry only an adulterer, or a partner, and the adulterers do not marry it except a lazy or a partner.
24|4|And those who threw the fortifications, then they did not come with four martyrs, so they will be eight years old, and they will not accept them.
24|5|Except those who repent after that
24|6|And those who throw their wives, and they have no martyrs except for themselves, so the testimony of one of them is four testimonies
24|7|And fifth that God cursed him if he is of the liars

24|11|Those who have come to dismantle a nerve They have great torment
24|12|Were it not for you, if you heard it, the believers and the believers think that they are good
24|13|If they had not come to him with four martyrs ۚ So if they did not come with the testimony, then you are the liar.

24|23|Those who throw the immunities of the believers who are believed in this world and the hereafter, and they have great torment
24|24|The day you will testify to them.

24|29|You have no lava to enter the homes of unhealthy, in which there is a pleasure for you ۚ And God knows what you see
24|30|Say to the believers, they turn a blind eye to their eyesight and keep their wives. ۚ That is the best of them.
24|31|And say to the believers, they will be angry with their eyesight, and they are keen 😂 And they do not appear to be their adornment except for their fathers, their fathers, or the fathers Their shame, the children of their brothers, their women, or what their faiths possessed orThe two followers are not the first of the male or the righteousness who did not appear on the women of the women. ۚ And you will repent to God, all the believers, that you may be successful

25|11|Rather, they lied in the hour ۖ and used to those who lied in the end.
25|12|If you see them from a place far away, they listen to it, and the exaggeration of it.
25|13|And when they are thrown from it a narrow place, they are coupled, they prayed for you.
25|14|Do not call one daytime and call a lot.

26|76|You and your father are the oldest
26|77|They are enemies to me except the Lord of the worlds
26|78|He who created me is guided
26|79|And who feeds me and wakes up
26|80|And if I am satisfied, it is healing
26|81|And who dies and then lives
26|82|And that I am aspiring to forgive me my sin on the Day of Religion
26|83|Lord, give me a judgment, and make me in mind
26|84|And make a sincere tongue for me
26|85|And make me from the heirs of the paradise
26|86|And forgive my father, it was one of the lost people
26|87|And do not humiliate me on the Day of Resurrection
26|88|Day whereon neither wealth nor sons
26|89|Except for those who come to God with a sound heart
26|90|Paradise was destroyed for the righteous
26|91|The healing was highlighted to the elders
26|92|We were told where what you worship
26|93|Without God Is Anasronkm or are winning
26|94|So they crouched on them and the lines
26|95|And the soldiers of the people are all
26|96|They said, and they are in it.
26|97|By Allah, if we are in manifest error
26|98|When we forget you with the Lord of the two worlds
26|99|And we are misleading except the criminals
26|100|So what we are among us
26|101|And no firm friend
26|102|Had to Nakrh then we are believers
26|103|In that, a verse is a verse.
26|104|And your Lord is the dear, the Most Merciful
26|105|The people of Noah lied
26|106|When their brother said to them, Noah is not to fear
26|107|I have a faithful messenger
26|108|Fear God and obey
26|109|And I do not ask you for a reward.
26|110|Fear God and obey
26|111|They said that I believe in you and the people follow you
26|112|He said, and what is my knowledge of what they were doing
26|113|If their account is only for my Lord, if you feel
26|114|And what I am in the muddam of the believers
26|115|If I am only a clear vow
26|116|"They said, ""No, you will not have it, O Noah."
26|117|My Lord said that my people lied
26|118|So open between me and between them, openness and release me, and whoever is among the believers
26|119|So we saved him and who with him in the aromatic ark
26|120|Then we impeded after the rest
26|121|In that, a verse is a verse.
26|122|And your Lord is the dear, the Most Merciful
26|123|The two messengers lied
26|124|When their brother said to them, there is no fear
26|125|I have a faithful messenger
26|126|Fear God and obey
26|127|And I do not ask you for a reward.
26|128|You are in every way that you will
26|129|And you will take the Musnat, so that you may be immortalized
26|130|And if you are overwhelmed by meables
26|131|Fear God and obey
26|132|Fear the one who provided you with what you know
26|133|I have provided you with nations and sons
26|134|Eyes and eyes
26|135|I am afraid of a great day for you
26|136|They said, if we were preached or did not be among the preachers.
26|137|If this is only the first one
26|138|And we are not tormented
26|139|So they lied to him, and we have their people ۗ, for that in that is a verse.
26|140|And your Lord is the dear, the Most Merciful
26|141|The deposits of the messengers lied
26|142|When their brother said to them, it is righteous.
26|143|I have a faithful messenger
26|144|Fear God and obey
26|145|And I do not ask you for a reward.
26|146|I leave in what we are safe
26|147|In the gardens
26|148|And a pill and a palm tree
26|149|And you are from the mountain
26|150|Fear God and obey
26|151|And do not obey the command of those who seek
26|152|Those who spoil the earth and do not reconcile
26|153|They said that you are one of the magicians
26|154|You are nothing but human beings like us
26|155|This is a camel that has drink, and you have a drink of knowledge.
26|156|And do not touch them with misfortune, so the torment of a great day will take you
26|157|So they are sole
26|158|The torment took them ۗ in that there is a verse.
26|159|And your Lord is the dear, the Most Merciful
26|160|The people of the messengers lied
26|161|When their brother said to them, Lot
26|162|I have a faithful messenger
26|163|Fear God and obey
26|164|And I do not ask you for a reward.
26|165|The remembrance came from the two worlds
26|166|And you will tell your Lord for you from your wives.
26|167|"They said, ""If you did not come"
26|168|He said that I am your work
26|169|Lord, we cultivate me and my family from what they do
26|170|So we saved him and his family
26|171|Except for a lavish in the parties
26|172|Then we destroy the others
26|173|And our rain on them is a rain.
26|174|In that, a verse is a verse.
26|175|And your Lord is the dear, the Most Merciful
26|176|He lied to the owners of the messengers
26|177|When he said to them, people did not fear
26|178|I have a faithful messenger
26|179|Fear God and obey
26|180|And I do not ask you for a reward.
26|181|They fulfilled the elderly, and do not be among the two losers
26|182|And decorate the straight
26|183|And do not underestimate the people, nor do you send in the land.
26|184|Fear the one who created you and the first mountains
26|185|They said that you are one of the magicians
26|186|And you are only human beings like us, and if we think you are among the liars
26|187|So we fell asleep from the sky, if you are the honest.
26|188|My Lord, I know what you are doing
26|189|So they lied to him and took them to the torment of the day
26|190|In that, a verse is a verse.
26|191|And your Lord is the dear, the Most Merciful
26|192|And to download the Lord of the Worlds
26|193|The faithful spirit descended with it
26|194|On your heart to be omniscient
26|195|A clear Arabic tongue
26|196|And it is in the firstborn of the first
26|197|Did they not have a sign for them to know the scholars of the children of Israel
26|198|And if we would have come down to some of the lavishness
26|199|So he read it to them what they were believers
26|200|Likewise, we have been in the hearts of the criminals
26|201|They do not believe in it until they see the empty torment
26|202|So they come to them, and they do not feel
26|203|So they say, are we looking?
26|204|Do we get hurry to us
26|205|Did you see if they enjoyed them years
26|206|Then they came to what they were promising
26|207|What they sing about what they enjoyed
26|208|And what we are from a village except for her
26|209|Remember and what we were unjust
26|210|And the two devils are not revealed
26|211|And what they want for them, and what they can
26|212|They are the hearing
26|213|Do not call with God another God, so you will be from the torment
26|214|And warn your closest adults
26|215|And reduce your wing of those who follow you from the believers
26|216|If you disobey you, say that I am innocent of what you do
26|217|And relied on the dear, the Most Merciful
26|218|He who sees you when you rise
26|219|And turn you in the prostitutes
26|220|It is the knowledgeable
26|221|Do I tell you about the one who descends the two devices
26|222|They descend on every sinful
26|223|They are heard and more likely
26|224|And the poets follow them
26|225|Did you not see that they are in every valley that they will
26|226|And they say what they do not do
26|227|Except those who believed and do righteous deeds and remind God a lot and they are left after what they did
27|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
27|2|Haddah and Hasr to the believers
27|3|Those who evaluate the prayers and pay zakat, and they are the last.
27|4|Those who do not believe in the hereafter are decorated with them their deeds, so they blind them
27|5|Those who have bad torment and are in the hereafter they are the ones who lose
27|6|And you will receive the Qur’an from a wise, knowledgeable
27|7|When Moses said to his family that I forgot a fire that will bring you from it with news, or bring you with a tribal lust that you may be overwhelmed
27|8|When it came to her, we would like that your blessing is in the fire and those around it, and the praise of God, Lord of the two worlds
27|9|O Moses, I am God, the dear, the wise
27|10|And he cast your stick ۚ when he saw it, it was removed, as if it was a paradise, and it is a mastermind, and it was not followed.
27|11|Except for those who wronged and then changed good after badness, then I am forgiving, merciful.
27|12|And enter your hands in your mountains, come out with a whiteness from badness.
27|13|When our verses came to them, they said: This is a clear magic
27|14|And they fell with it and their souls are unjustly and high ۚ So see how it was the punishment of the spoilers
27|15|And we have come to Dawood and Solomon with knowledge.
27|16|And Solomon David inherited ۖ And he said: O people, we teach us the goods of the bird and our death from everything
27|17|Sloan was gathered by his soldiers from jinn, mankind and birds, they distribute
27|18|"Until they came to the valley of the nose, I said, ""O you, the teller"
27|19|So you will be laid down from his saying, and the Lord said, “Show me to thank you Your good servants
27|20|And the goodness was lost, so he said: What I have not seen the thigh
27|21|I will torture him with a severe torment, or to slaughter him, or let me come to me with a clear authority
27|22|So he stayed after a long time, and he said, I put what you did not surround, and I brought you from a curse with a wearing
27|23|I found a woman who owns their own
27|24|I found it and its people prostrate to the sun without God, and the Satan has decorated them with their deeds, so they repelled them from the path, so they are not.
27|25|Do not prostrate to God who brings hide in the heavens and the earth and knows what you are hidden and what you declare
27|26|God is no god but He, He is the Lord of the Great Throne
27|27|He said they have ratified, we will look, or you liars
27|28|I went to my book, so he gave them to them, then he took over them, so look at them
27|29|She said: O shell, I will throw a generous book to me
27|30|"and it is from sulaiman and it is ""In the name of Allah the most Beneficent and the Merciful"
27|31|Do not rise to me and come to me Muslims
27|32|She said: O shell, you will see me in my command.
27|33|They said: “The first of the power and the first is a tasty, and the matter is to you, so see what you command
27|34|She said that when they entered a village, they spoiled them and made the best of its people humiliated ۖ and likewise they will do
27|35|And I am a messenger to them with a guidance, so we look at what the messengers return
27|36|When Solomon came, he said: “Do you extend money, so what God has given me is better than what came to you, but you are in your guidance, you will be happy
27|37|Return to them, so let us bring them with soldiers who are not accepted by them, and let us leave them from them.
27|38|He said: O shell, which of you will come to me with her throne before they come to me, Muslims
27|39|Afrit said from jinn that I will give you before you to rise from your place ۖ and that I have a faithful power
27|40|He said, who has a knowledge of the book, that I will give you before it is that you will be able to see you. Or I disbelieve 😂 and whoever thank you, but he thank you for himself.
27|41|"He said, ""We will see her."
27|42|When it came, it was said that you are your throne.
27|43|Its echo was what she worshiped without God
27|44|It was said to her, enter the explanation. I greeted with Solomon to God, Lord of the two worlds
27|45|We have sent us to their brother, righteous, that they worship God, so if they are two parties, they will be seen
27|46|He said, O people, why would you be hurry up with the bad before the goodness 😂 If you would not be forgiven, may God be forgiven, you may be merciful
27|47|They said, “Tour us with you and with those with you ۚ Your pilot said with God 😂 Rather, you are people who are fascinated
27|48|And in the city, there are nineteenths, spoiling in the land, and they are not reconciled
27|49|They said, “God bless him and his family, and then let us say to his guardian what we have witnessed, your family
27|50|And they are deceived, and we are deceived, and they do not feel
27|51|So see how the punishment of their deception was that we have destroyed them and their people all
27|52|So that their homes are Khwayeh with what they have been wronged.
27|53|And those who believed and they were righteous
27|54|And in terms, when he said to his people, you will come to the obscene, and you see.
27|55|You will come to men without women without women ۚ Rather, you are people who are ignorant
27|56|So what was the opponents of his people except that they said they were brought out to the family
27|57|So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We destined her to be of those who remained behind
27|58|And our rain on them is a rain.
27|59|Say praise to God and peace be upon His servants who have chosen ۗ God is better.
27|60|So the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the heavens of the heavens for you They are people who adjust
27|61|The sake of making the land a decision and made its Khalla with rivers, and made it for her a raw and made between the two seas a barrier of God with God, with God, with God, with God, with God
27|62|Who will answer the obligatory when he calls him and reveals badness and makes you the successors of the earth ۗ God with God
27|63|Who will guide you in the darkness of righteousness and the sea, and whoever sends the winds a good between the hands of his mercy ۗ God with God, may God bless you
27|64|So who begins creation and then restores it and whoever provides you with heaven and earth
27|65|Say: I do not know who in the heavens and the earth is unseen except God ۚ And what they feel when they are sent
27|66|Rather, your knowledge of their knowledge in the hereafter ۚ but they are in doubt of them ۖ but they are among them.
27|67|And those who disbelieved said that if we were dust and our parents are so coming out
27|68|We have prepared this and our parents before before
27|69|Say: Walk in the land, so look at how the punishment of the criminals was
27|70|Do not be sad about them, nor are you in the narrowness of what you are.
27|71|And they say when this is a promise if you are true
27|72|Say: May it be a response to you, some of those who hurry
27|73|And your Lord is a grace over people, but many of them do not thank you.
27|74|And your Lord will know what their breasts are and what they are declared
27|75|And there is no absent in the sky and the earth except in a clear book
27|76|This is the Qur’an that cuts the children
27|77|And it is a guidance and mercy for the believers
27|78|Your Lord will judge between them with his judgment ۚ and he is the dear, knowledgeable
27|79|So he relied on God.
27|80|You do not listen
27|81|And you are not with the meaning of the blind person from the misguidance of the accusation.
27|82|And if the saying is signed upon them, we will bring them a bear from the earth, and they will speak to them that people were with our signs that they do not believe in
27|83|On the day we are gathered from every nation, a woman who lies with our verses, they distribute
27|84|Until, when they came, he said, I lied to my revelations and did not surround it with knowledge, you were doing
27|85|And the saying came to them with what they wronged, so they do not
27|86|Did they not see that we made the night to live in it and the day is insightful.
27|87|On the day he is blown up in pictures, so he will be lost in the heavens, and whoever is in the earth, except for whom God wills
27|88|And you see the mountains that you calculate it, and it is the bitter of the cloud ۚ The manufacture of God who mastered everything
27|89|Whoever comes with goodness has a good from them, and they are from the fear of the day.
27|90|And whoever comes to the bad, their faces are in the fire, so they will be rewarded except what you were doing
27|91|I only commanded to worship the Lord of this country, which he has forbidden and has everything.
27|92|And to recite the Qur’an.
27|93|And say praise to God, will show you his signs, so you will know them ۚ And what your Lord is unaware of what you do
28|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
28|2|Those are the verses of the book
28|3|We have the same from the prophecy
28|4|Pharaoh is on the ground and made its people a sheep that weakens a group of them from them, and their children will be slaughtered and their women are ashamed of their women.
28|5|We want to sleep on those who are weakened in the land and make them imams and make them the heirs
28|6|And we can in the land and see Pharaoh and the two imams and their soldiers from them what they were warning
28|7|And we referred to the mother of Moses to be present to him.
28|8|So Pharaoh picked it up to be an enemy and a sadness ۗ, if Pharaohs and Haman and their soldiers were wrong
28|9|And I said, Pharaoh, I decided to be a eyes for me and you. Do not kill him.
28|10|And the heart of the mother of Moses, and the sacrifice of the empty of it.
28|11|She said to his sister, his storytelling.
28|12|We have been forbidden by the place before him, so I said: I will show you the people of a house that they will guarantee it for you
28|13|We repeated him to his mother, so that her eyes would be approved, and do not grieve, and know that the promise of God is a right
28|14|And when he reached the most severe and equal, we gave him judgment and knowledge.
28|15|And the city entered the time of his family, and he found two men in it. He is from his enemy, and Moses, and he spent on him. He said this is from the work
28|16|My Lord said that I did my soul, so forgive me and forgive him ۚ He is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful
28|17|My Lord said what you have been blessed with me, and I will not be the noon of the criminals
28|18|So he became in the city of the city, so he will be monitored, so if he who is victorious with the evening, he will be shouting.
28|19|When I want to be thirsty with those who are an enemy of them, he said, Moses, I want to kill me as you kill me as a soul And what you want to be among the prayers
28|20|"A man came from the shortest city, he said, ""Moses, that the pain is coming to you to kill you, so I will come out, for you from the one who is the one."
28|21|So he came out of it as a vagina.
28|22|And when he went to meet the city, he said, my Lord, that he guided me to the path.
28|23|And when he returned the water of the city, he found a nation from the people who were watered and found from them without two women. Crockery 😂 And our father is a great sheikh
28|24|So he gave them to them, then he took over to the shadow, and my Lord said that I did not descend to me from the best of the good.
28|25|So one of them came to walk on the sacrifice of the people, and I said that my father invites you to reward you You are from the unjust people
28|26|One of them said, O Father, I renounce it.
28|27|He said that I want to marry you, one of my daughters You find me if God wills from the righteous
28|28|He said that between me and between you.
28|29|When Moses spent the sake of the sake of his family, he was forgotten from the side of the phase, he said to his family You will get up
28|30|When she came to her, he would like to be the beach of the valley in the blessed spot from the tree that Moses, I am God, the Lord of the worlds
28|31|And if he threw your stick, then when he saw it, it is removed, as if it is a paradise, and it is a mastermind, and it was not punished.
28|32|I ask you in your mountain Film
28|33|My Lord said that I killed them as a soul, so I am afraid to kill me
28|34|And my brother, Harun, is the most eloquent of me for a tongue, so I send it with me a response that believes me.
28|35|He said we will seek your support with your brother, and we will make you a sultan, so they will not pray to you ۚ with our verses, you and whoever follows you
28|36|When Moses came to them with our signs, they said: What is this except a void magic, and what we have heard of us in our parents are the first
28|37|Moses, my Lord, knows who is the one who came with the guidance of him, and whoever has the consequence of the house.
28|38|And Pharaoh said, O you, what I have learned from God, so I will be lost to me I do not think it is one of the liars
28|39|He is the arrogance of his soldiers in the land without the truth, and they thought that they would not be returned to us
28|40|So we took it and his soldiers, so we rejected them in the day.
28|41|And we made them imams calling for fire ۖ and on the day of resurrection, they would not be victorious
28|42|And we followed them in this worldly curse 😂 And on the day of resurrection they are from the dominances
28|43|And Moses, the book, came from after what we have for the first centuries.
28|44|And what you were in the side of the West, when we spent the matter to Moses, and what you were among the two witnesses
28|45|But we created a century, so the life of them is dominated by them.
28|46|And what you were in the side of the phase, when we called us, but a mercy from your Lord, to warn the people of what they have come
28|47|Were it not for them to be afflicted with what they have given to them, then they would say, “We may not send us a messenger, so you will follow you, and you will follow you.
28|48|When the truth came to them from us, they said: If not for what Moses did not die, Moses did not. They are infidels
28|49|Say: So come with a book from God
28|50|If they do not respond to you, know that they will follow their whims ۚ and whoever is more than one who follows his passion for the sake
28|51|We have prayed for them. They may remember them.
28|52|Those who came to whom the book came before him, they believe in it.
28|53|And when they are followed by them, they said, “We believe in it, for the truth is from our Lord, we were before him.
28|54|Those are their wages, two times, with what they have been patient and seek the bad good, and what we have agreed upon
28|55|And when they hear the linguist, they expose it to him and said to us our deeds, and you have your deeds, peace be upon you, and we do not seek the ignorant people
28|56|You do not guide those who loved you, but God guides whoever wills ۚ and he knows the guidance
28|57|And they said that we follow the guidance with you, we are kidnapped from our satisfaction. They know
28|58|And how many of our people are from a village that fled her livelihood, so that their dwellings did not live in them, but only a little
28|59|And your Lord was not the village of the villages until he sent a messenger in her mother, and our signs are attached to them.
28|60|And what you have given up is the enjoyment of this worldly life and its adornment ۚ And what God has good and the most is the best of God.
28|61|Whoever promises it and promises it good, it is the one who met it as the enjoyment of the enjoyment of this worldly life, then it is the day of the resurrection
28|62|And on the day he calls them, and he says where my partners are those who were claiming
28|63|Those who have the right to say: “Our Lord, those who have seduced us, we have seen them as we have seen us”
28|64|And it was said that they called your partners, so they called them, and they did not respond to them and saw the torment ۚ if they were guided
28|65|And on the day he calls them and says what you answered the messengers
28|66|The prophets blinded them to them, so they did not ask.
28|67|As for those who repent and believe and do righteousness, he would be a good man.
28|68|And your Lord creates whatever he wants and chooses ۗ What they had good ۚ Glory be to God and the Most High
28|69|And your Lord knows what their breasts and what they declare
28|70|And He is God, no god but He, He is the Praise be to him in the first and the hereafter.
28|71|Say: I have seen that God has made you the night to the night of resurrection, whoever God will not come to you
28|72|Say: I have seen that God has made the day to you, to the day of resurrection, who is God, other than God
28|73|And from his mercy, he made you the night and the day for you to dwell in it, and to seek from its grace, and perhaps you will thank you
28|74|And on the day he calls them, and he says where my partners are those who were claiming
28|75|And we were removed from every martyr nation, so we told us, they will be blessed.
28|76|If they were from the people of Moses, then they were overwhelmed by them. - God does not love the joy
28|77|And you seek the rest of God. Sidin
28|78|He said that I did not know him with my knowledge of me. Their rituals are the criminals
28|79|So he came out to his people in his adornment.
28|80|And those who have given the knowledge, and you have the goodness of God, is better for those who believe and do righteousness, and do not throw it except those who are patient

29|2|The people are almost left to say that they are safe and they are not fascinated
29|3|And we have missed those who were before them.
29|4|Or according to those who do the misfortunes to precede us ۚ Well what they judge
29|5|Whoever hopes to meet God, for God is the best of God, and he is the hearing
29|6|And whoever strives, but he will strive for itself ۚ God is singing from the two worlds

29|13|And let them make their garments and the garments with their hearts ۖ and they will not ask the Day of Resurrection as they were fascinating
29|14|We have sent Noah to his people, and a thousand years have been established in them, except for five years, so the flood took them and they are the shadow of

29|16|And Abraham, when he said to his people, worship God and fear Him.
29|17|Rather, you worship without God, and you will be dismantled. Do it and thank him for it
29|18|And if you lie, then he lied to nations before you.
29|19|Did they not see how God begins creation and then restores it ۚ that is for God to walk
29|20|Say: Walk in the land, and look at how the creation began.
29|21|It punishes whom He wills and has mercy on him and Tqlpon

29|23|And those who disbelieve in the verses of God and to protect him, those who are from my mercy and those who have a painful torment
29|24|So what was the opponents of his people except that they said, kill him or burn him, and God saved him from fire ۚ in that there is no signs of people who believe
29|25|He said: You are taken from God without God in this life The fire and what you have are supporters
29|26|So he has a descendant ۘ and said that I am a migration to my Lord.
29|27|And we gave him a cruise, and he will make us in the offspring of the Prophet and the Book, and we have given him a reward in the world and for the sake of the world.
29|28|And in terms of his people, he said to his people, that you will not come obscene
29|29|You will come to the men, and you will be cut off, and you will come in your call Come

29|31|And when our messengers came to Abraham, they said: We are the people of this village.
29|32|He said that there is a despair in it ۚ They said: “We know who is in it”.
29|33|And when our messengers came to a bad way to them, and they were made by them, and they said: Do not be afraid, and do not be sad.
29|34|We are the people of this village, as a result of the sky, as they were immoral
29|35|And we have left it from a clear verse of people who are reasonable
29|36|And to the religion of their brother, a people, so he said, O people, worship God and wrap the last day, and do not send in the land.
29|37|So they lied to him, so they took them.
29|38|Upha, and a thunder, and you have been shown to you from their dwellings.
29|39|Calculators, Paradise, and Haman ۖ And Moses came to them with the evidence, so they arranged in the land and what they were preceded
29|40|So all of us took his sins. It is to oppress them, but they were themselves
29|41|The example of those who took from God without the saints of the first place, as well
29|42|God knows what they call without something
29|43|Those sayings cite people and Aaklha only knowledgeable
29|44|God created the heavens and the earth in truth.

29|51|Was it not enough for them that we have revealed to you the book to be followed by them.
29|52|Say: Affairs of God between me and you are a martyr.
29|53|And they hurry you with torment ۚ and if not for the name of the torture, the torment will come to them, and they will not come to them, and they do not feel.

29|59|Those who have been patient and their Lord, they eat
29|60|As well as from a bear that you do not carry, may God bless her and you, and he is the hearing
29|61|And if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth and the sun and the moon mocked to say God 😂 So I am helping you
29|62|God simplifies the sustenance of whomever He wills from his worshipers
29|63|And if you asked them whoever has come from the sky, then they revived the earth from after its death, so that God will say to God, say: “God is God.”
29|64|And this is the worldly life except for fun and a game.
29|65|So if they installed in the aromatic, they prayed to God, the religion of the religion, then when they saved them to righteousness, when they are involved
29|66|Let them atone for what we have come to, and to enjoy.
29|67|Did they not see that we made us a safe sanctity and kidnap people from around them ۚ
29|68|And whoever is hurt by those who have fled to God as a lie or lied to the truth when he came to him ۚ Is it not in Hell in Hell.
29|69|And those who strive in us to guide them are our paths.

30|9|They did not walk in the land, and they see how the punishment of those before them. ۚ They were more powerful than them They are their messengers with the evidence. What God would have wronged them, but they were themselves
30|10|Then the punishment of those who worsened the goodness that they lied to the verses of God and were mocking it
30|11|God begins creation and then returns it and then to Him to return
30|12|On the day when the time is wearing the criminals
30|13|And they did not have an intercession and they were with their partners as disbelievers
30|14|On the day, the hour will be separated.
30|15|As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they are in a ritual.
30|16|As for those who disbelieved and lied to our verses and met the last, those in torment are prepared
30|17|Glory be to God when you are touched, and they become
30|18|And he has praise in the heavens, the earth, and the east, and when they appear
30|19|The neighborhood is removed from the dead, and the dead comes out of the neighborhood, and the land revives after its death.
30|20|And from his signs that he created you from dust, then if you are human, you will be published
30|21|And from his signs that he created for you from your souls, wives, so that you can dwell on them and make among you a dedication and mercy in you.
30|22|And from his signs the creation of the heavens and the earth and the disagreement of your tongue and your colors ۚ in that there are verses for the worlds
30|23|And from his signs of your sleep with night and day, and your concern for his grace ۚ in that in that there are peoples for people who hear
30|24|And from his signs, lightning shows you fear and greed and removes from the sky with water, and the earth will live with it after its death ۚ
30|25|And from his signs that the sky and the earth will rise with his command ۚ Then if he calls you a call from the earth, if you go out
30|26|And he has those in the heavens and the earth.
30|27|And he is the one who begins creation and then returns it, and he is the most insignificant to him ۚ and he has the highest example in the heavens and the earth and the earth.
30|28|You have been set for you for example from your souls? That we separate the verses of people who are reasonable
30|29|Rather, follow those who wronged themselves with knowledge of knowledge.
30|30|So make your face to the religion of the religion ۚ So God blessed the people who break the people on it ۚ Do not change the creation of God ۚ That is the religion of the religion and the religion of God
30|31|Passionate to him, fear him, and establish prayers, and do not be among the participants.
30|32|Who among those who separated their religion and they were Shi'a 😂 every party with what they have, joyful

30|34|Let them atone for what we have come to ۚ So they enjoyed, and you will know
30|35|Or did we send them to them, as it is speaking of what they were sharing
30|36|And if people tasted us with mercy, then they will be happy with it.
30|37|Will they not see that God is the simplification of livelihood for whom He wills and appreciate ۚ If in that there are peoples who believe in
30|38|So the closeness is his right, the poor, and the son of the way ۚ That is better for those who want the face of God
30|39|And what you come from a Lord to be raised in the money of the people, so they do not raise it with God.
30|40|God who created you, then your livelihood, then he will die and then revive you 😂 Is it from your partners who do from you from something
30|41|Corruption appeared in the righteousness and the sea with what the hands of the people have earned, so that some of those who have done to them may be given to them.
30|42|Say: Walk in the land, so look at how the punishment of those before before ۚ most of them were partners
30|43|So make your face to the valuable debt before it comes to a day that has no response from God.
30|44|Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief, and whoever does righteousness, will have themselves
30|45|Let those who believe and do righteous deeds from his grace ۚ He does not love the disbelievers
30|46|It is from his signs that the wind sends good tidings, and to give you from his mercy, and the ark is left with his command, and they will be forgiven
30|47|And we sent a messenger before you to their people, so they came to them with evidence, so we resided from those who have been done.
30|48|God who sends the winds, then he enriches a cloud, and he will be in the sky. From his worshipers, if they are preaching
30|49|And if they were before them to be revealed before him
30|50|So look at the effects of the mercy of God, how to revive the earth after her death ۚ If this is a good wiped
30|51|And if we sent a wind, and they saw it as a yellowish, so they will disbelieve after it.
30|52|For you do not hear the dead, nor do the deafness be heard, so if they are managed
30|53|And what you are in the murder of the blindness from the misfortune
30|54|God, who created you from weakness, then made after the weakness of power, then he made after a power of weakness and a meteor
30|55|On the day the time is divided into the criminals, they would have been over an hour.
30|56|And those who have given the knowledge and faith said that you have been in the book of God to the day of the resurrection.
30|57|So, then those who have been unjust, their excuses, do not benefit
30|58|And we have been struck for people in this Qur’an from every example ۚ And if you came to them with a verse, they will say to those who disbelieve if you are not.
30|59|Likewise, God is printed on the hearts of those who do not know
30|60|So be patient, that the promise of God is a right.

36|12|We live the dead and write what they came and their effects ۚ And everything we have counted in a clear Imam
36|13|And they have a proverb, for example, the owners of the village, when the messengers came to them

37|58|What do we do with two days?
37|59|Otherwise, our first death, and what we are tormented
37|60|This is the great winner
37|61|For example, let the workers do
37|62|This is the best of the tree of al -Zaqum
37|63|We made it a temptation for the unjust
37|64|It is a tree that comes out in the origin of hell
37|65|Its proliferation is as if the heads of the shades
37|66|For they are eaten from them, so they are fled from them.
37|67|Then they have a grave from Humim
37|68|Then they return them to hell
37|69|They have fulfilled their fathers
37|70|They are on their effects

37|79|Peace be upon Noah in the two worlds
37|80|So do I. We recompense benefactors
37|81|It is one of our believers
37|82|Then we immersed the others
37|83|And it is from his Shiites to Abraham
37|84|If his Lord came with a sound heart
37|85|When he said to his father and his people, what do you worship
37|86|Doubes of God without God you want

37|99|He said that I went to my Lord, who will guide me
37|100|Lord, give me from the righteous

37|113|And we blessed him and on Isaac ۚ and from their offspring is good and rude to himself is clear
37|114|And we are based on Moses and Harun
37|115|We saved them and their people from the great end
37|116|And we supported them, and they were the two people
37|117|And we gave them the book, the book
37|118|And we guided them

37|143|Were it not for the praise
37|144|To broadcast in his stomach to a day they are sent
37|145|So we rejected him with nakedness
37|146|And we reported to him a tree of two cats
37|147|And we sent it to a hundred thousand or increased
37|148|So believe and enjoy them until
37|149|Your Lord, your Lords, have the sons, and they have the children
37|150|Or did we create the angels as a female and they witnessed
37|151|They are not from their dismantling to say
37|152|God's child, and they are liars
37|153|Step the girls on the sons
37|154|Malcolm, how do you judge
37|155|Do you not remember?
37|156|Or a clear sultanate for you
37|157|So come with your book if you are true
37|158|And they made between it and the arrival of the paradise.
37|159|Glory be to God, what they describe
37|160|Except the worshipers of God
37|161|You and what you worship
37|162|You are not with two signs
37|163|Except for those who are the valve
37|164|And there is no knowledgeable
37|165|We are the pure
37|166|We are praised
37|167|And if they would say
37|168|If we had a remembrance of the first two
37|169|We were the worshipers of God
37|170|So they disbelieved in it. So they knew
37|171|And our word for our messengers has preceded our messengers.
37|172|They have the ones who are photographers
37|173|And our changer for them is the majority
37|174|So he went on to them until time
37|175|And see them, and they see you
37|176|Do we get hurry to us
37|177|So when we descended in their open
37|178|And he went on to them until then
37|179|And see the time they see
37|180|Praise Lord, the Lord of Glory what they describe
37|181|And peace be upon the messengers
37|182|and thank Allah the god of everything
38|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
38|2|Rather, those who disbelieved in pride and shirts
38|3|How many of them were from a horn, they called and called for a while.
38|4|And they liked that they were warned of them ۖ and the disbelievers said this is a liar magician
38|5|Make the gods one God one 😂 If this is a wondered thing
38|6|And the fullness of them is that they walk and be patient with your God.
38|7|We have not heard of this in the last mortality, if this is only a creation
38|8|I have the remembrance of us among us ۚ Rather they are in doubt of my remembrance.
38|9|Or have the trap of the mercy of your dear Lord
38|10|Or do they have the king of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them.
38|11|A soldier is what is defeated by the parties
38|12|The people of Noah lied before them, and the people of the bodies.
38|13|And the steadfastness, the people of Lot, and the owners
38|14|If only the messengers lied
38|15|And what is the same as a sacrifice.
38|16|"And they said, ""Our Lord, to hurry to us before the day of the account"
38|17|Be patient with what they say and remember our servants.
38|18|We have grown with the mountains with it, praising the living and the east
38|19|And the bird is stuffed.
38|20|We tightened his king and we gave him the wisdom and separated the speech
38|21|And the news of the characteristic came to you when they walked the war?
38|22|When they entered the Dawood, then they were lost from them. T.
38|23|This is my brother has nine and you will seek a nine, and I have a single paste, so he said, I will guarantee it and comfort me in the speech
38|24|He said that you have been wronged by the question of your erases. ۗ Dawood thought that he had destroyed him, so he asked his Lord, and he was blessed and repent.
38|25|So we forgive him for that ۖ And for him, we have a successful and good man
38|26|O Dawood, we have made you a successor in the land, so you will be among the people with the truth It is hard for what they forgot the day of the account
38|27|And we did not create the sky and the earth, and what is between them in vain.
38|28|Or do we make those who believe and do righteous deeds like the spoilers in the land, or do we make the righteous like the heep
38|29|A book that we descended to you is your blessing to manage its signs, and to remember the parents
38|30|And we gave us to Daoud Solomon ۚ Yes, the servant.
38|31|When he was presented to him with the sacrifices of the good.
38|32|He said that I loved the love of goodness from the remembrance of my Lord until I was raised by the veil
38|33|They responded to me.
38|34|Solomon had missed us, and we gave us a generous body and then repay
38|35|The Lord said, forgive me and give me a king who does not want anyone after me.
38|36|So the wind was harnessed for him
38|37|And the two days are all constructions and sediments
38|38|And others are coupled in the side
38|39|This is our giving, so we are, or I have been touched by a calculation
38|40|And if he has a good and good
38|41|And the servants of us, Ayoub, when his Lord called that I was a sinner and torture
38|42|Run with your feet. This is a cold and a drink
38|43|And we gave him his family and the same with them with mercy from us, and I remember the first of the doors.
38|44|And take your hand as a curse, and be sure of it, and do not come to you, but we found it patient ۚ Yes, the servant is
38|45|And mention our worshipers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the first of the hands and the eyesight
38|46|We have made them clear with the remembrance of the house
38|47|And they are among us who are selected.
38|48|And remember the hearing, and the expansion, and the guarantee.
38|49|This is a male ۚ and for those who fear the good
38|50|The gardens of an enemy opened to them the doors
38|51|In which they call in it a lot of fruits and drink.
38|52|And they have the baccalaureate of the parties
38|53|This is what you promise to the day
38|54|This is for us to give us what it has
38|55|This ۚ And the tyrants have a mold
38|56|Hell, they prayed to her, and the misery
38|57|So, let them be a garment and an wash
38|58|And another of its shape
38|59|This is a fool with you.
38|60|They said, but you are not welcomed by you.
38|61|They said, our Lord, whoever came to us, and he increased it with a weakness in the fire
38|62|And they said: What we have not seen as men, we were promising them from the evil.
38|63|We took them ridiculous, or the eyesight was overlooked by them
38|64|That is a right to the people of the fire
38|65|Say: I am a warning.
38|66|Lord of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them, the dear, the forgiveness
38|67|Say a great news
38|68|You are offering it
38|69|I did not have the knowledge of the highest, when they were sealed.
38|70|If it is revealed to me except that I am a clear vow
38|71|When your Lord said to the angels that I am a creator of mud
38|72|So if I settled it and breathed in it from my soul, then they will fall into it.
38|73|So all the angels prostrated
38|74|But the devil was arrogant and was one of the disbelievers
38|75|He said, Obissa, what prevented you from prostrating for what I created with me 😂 You arrogated or you were among the calves
38|76|He said that I am better than him.
38|77|He said then get out, you are accursed
38|78|If you Antaeus to the Day of Judgment
38|79|He said: My Lord, the Day of Resurrection
38|80|He said that you are from the eyes
38|81|To the day of the known time
38|82|He said, and I will beg you, and they will be seen all of them
38|83|Except for your worshipers of the two of them
38|84|He said the truth and the truth I say
38|85|I hope that he is hell from you and whoever follows you from all of them
38|86|Say what I ask you for a reward, and what I am in charge.
38|87|It is only a male for the two worlds
38|88|And you know his news after time
39|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
39|2|We have revealed to you the book with the truth, so God worships the religion of the religion
39|3|There is no pure religion for God, and those who took from him without him are the guardians of what we worship them except to bring us closer to God. ۗ God does not guide those who are a liar as disbelief
39|4|If God wanted to take a child, he would not be able
39|5|He created the heavens and the earth with the truth. And the dear, the forgiveness
39|6|He created you from one soul Three ۚ God, your Lord, has the King.
39|7|If you disbelieve, then God is rich in Return you and tell you what you were doing ۚ He is aware of the souls of the breasts
39|8|And when a person touches a harmful person, his Lord is called to him, then when he was blessed with a blessing from him, he would not be forgotten from him. Say: You enjoy a little disbelief.
39|9|As for it is the right of the night, a righteous and a righteous warning Remember the parents
39|10|Say, O servants of those who believe, fear your Lord ۚ For those who have good in this world, good ۗ and the land of God, and the sake of God.
39|11|Say: I have commanded God to be saved for the religion
39|12|And I ordered that I be the first Muslims
39|13|Say: I am afraid that I disobey my Lord, a great day
39|14|Tell God I worship him sincere religious
39|15|So worship what you have wanted
39|16|They have a shadow from the fire and from under them shadow ۚ That is the fear of God with His worshipers ۚ O servants of and fear
39|17|And those who fought the tyrants to worship them and pulled them to God for them to be good
39|18|Those who listen
39|19|Will it do you have the right to the word of the torment?
39|20|But those who fear their Lord have a lamb from them above them.
39|21|Did you not see that God has come out of the sky with water, so he walked in the land in the earth, then he will be removed from it. ۚ If this is a remembrance of the first people
39|22|Will God explain his chest to Islam, he is on the light of his Lord ۚ Fawal to the Massion of their hearts from the remembrance of God ۚ first
39|23|God has descended the best of the hadith, a similar book, and I will feel from it. God is guided by whom He wills.
39|24|Will he fear the face of the bad torture on the Day of Resur
39|25|He lied to those who were before them, and the torment came to them from where they did not feel
39|26|So God, the treacherous in this world
39|27|And we have been struck for people in this Qur’an from every example, perhaps they remember
39|28|An Arab Qur’an, unaware of them, perhaps they fear
39|29|God set an example for a man in which there are partners and a man who is peaceful for a man, who would be equal for example ۚ Praise be to God, but God is more
39|30|You are dead, and they are dead
39|31|Then you are the Day of Resurrection with your Lord
39|32|Whoever is more darkened to those who lied to God and lied to the honesty when he came to him ۚ Is it not in hell as a matter of disbelievers
39|33|And that came with the honesty and believed in it ۙ those who are the ones who are righteous.
39|34|They have what they want with their Lord ۚ That is the reward of the good.
39|35|Let God atone for them, who did those who did and reward them with their reward for the best of those who were doing
39|36|Is God not a sufficiency of His servant ۖ and they will fear you with those without him ۚ And whoever is misled by God, then what he has is this
39|37|And whoever guides God, he has no misleading
39|38|And if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth will say to God. I have mercy on me, is it the silence of his mercy?
39|39|Say: O people, do your place, I am a worker.
39|40|Whoever is brought to him is a torture that he shares and is resolved to him
39|41|We have revealed to you the book for people with the truth ۖ Whoever is guided, let us find it.
39|42|God dies the soul when it is dead, and it was not fulfilled in her dreams. Verses of people who think
39|43|Or did they take from God?
39|44|Say to God the intercession all 😂 He has the king of the heavens and the earth.
39|45|And when God is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter ۖ And when those who are not mentioned, then those who have been reminded of it, then they are not.
39|46|Say, O God, break the heavens, the earth, the world of the unseen and the testimony, that you judge between your servants in what they were in it.
39|47|And even if those who have been wronged for all of the earth, and the same with him, they would not have forgiven him from the bad torment on the day
39|48|And they had bad things for them.
39|49|So when a person touches a harm, then he called us, then when we leave it a blessing from us, he said, “I have given it to the knowledge of it, but it is not, but it is not.
39|50|He said to those who were before them, so what they sing about them.
39|51|So they are bad for what they have earned ۚ and those who have been wronged from these people will be affected by the bad things that they have earned and what they are in the miracle
39|52|Did they not know that God simplifies the livelihood for whom He wills and appreciates ۚ in that there are peoples who believe in
39|53|Say, O my servants who have forgotten themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God.
39|54|And give to your Lord, and give him peace before him, that the torment will come to you, then you will not be victorious
39|55|And follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord from before that the torment will come to you, and you do not feel
39|56|To say a soul, O, you will be pleased with what I have been overwhelmed by God
39|57|Or do you say that God guided me, I would be among the righteous
39|58|Or you say when you see the torment, even if I have a hat
39|59|I have come to you, my signs, so you lied to it, and you have been arrogant, and you were among the disbelievers
39|60|On the day of the resurrection, you see those who lied to God and their faces are boring?
39|61|And God who feared themselves survived by their reward
39|62|God is the creator of everything.
39|63|He has the arms of the heavens and the earth ۗ and those who disbelieve in the verses of God are the ones who are the losers
39|64|Say: Otherwise, you will command me to worship, O ignorant people
39|65|And I have been revealed to you and to those who were before you, if you have been blessed, and you will love your work, and you will be among the losers
39|66|Rather, God is worshiped and be among the two complainants
39|67|And they did not appreciate God, the right of His destiny and the earth, all of which are held on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens are fold
39|68|And he was blown in the pictures, so he raised those in the heavens and from the earth, except for those who wish God 😭 Then he was blown in it in another
39|69|And the land was broken by the light of its Lord, and the book was placed, and the prophets and the testimony came to the prophets and the testimony.
39|70|And every soul has fulfilled what it has done, and it knows what they do.
39|71|And the one who disbelieved to Hell is a time. And they warn you for the meeting
39|72|It was said, enter the doors of Hell, immortal in it.
39|73|And those who fear their Lord to Paradise as a perception of paradise.
39|74|And they said, praise be to God, who believed us and promised us, and the earth inherited us, we will see from Paradise, where we will be blessed.
39|75|And the angels see those who are barefoot about the throne, praising the praise of their Lord ۖ and spent between them the truth and the Lord of the Lord said:
40|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
40|2|Download the Book from God, the Glory be to God
40|3|The sins and the affection of the repentance of the holy punishment are the one who is long.
40|4|What is said in the signs of God except those who disbelieved, so they will not be deceived by their hearts in the country
40|5|The people of Noah and the parties were lied to them. They were a punishment
40|6|Likewise, your Lord has spoken to those who disbelieved that they are the owners of fire
40|7|Those who carry the throne and those around him praise the praise of their Lord, and they believe in it and seek forgiveness for those who believe - For those who repent and follow your paths and their torment of hell
40|8|Our Lord and enter the gardens of the enemy of the one who promised them and whoever reconciles from their fathers and their wives and their offspring ۚ You are the best
40|9|And their misfortunes ۚ and whoever meets the bad things, then she has mercy
40|10|Those who disbelieve are calling for God more than your own, when you pray for faith, and you will be atone
40|11|They said, our Lord, we have two years, and we lived by two of us, so we converted us with our sins, so do you go to the elderly
40|12|That is that if God called alone, you disbelieved.
40|13|He is the one who shows you his signs and sends you a liveli
40|14|So pray to God, and those who have the religion, and if the disbelievers will be disbelieved
40|15|Raveling of the domers with the throne, the soul will be thrown from his command to whom he wants from his worshipers to warn
40|16|The day they are high
40|17|Today, every soul is rewarded with what you have earned ۚ There is no injustice to the day ۚ God is fasting
40|18|And warn them on the day of the burden, when the hearts are the ones who are shoes.
40|19|He knows the traitors of the eyes, and what is hidden from the breasts
40|20|And God will judge the truth ^ And those who call from it without it, they do not spend anything
40|21|Did they not walk in the land, and they would see how the punishment of those who were before them ۚ They were more powerful than them And what they had of God
40|22|That is because they were bringing their messengers with evidence, so they disbelieved, and God took them ۚ He is a strong and hidden one
40|23|Moses has sent us with our verses and sultanate.
40|24|To Pharaoh, Haman, and two continents, they said a liar witch.
40|25|When they came to them in the truth from us, they said, kill the sons of those who believed with him and embarrassed their women ۚ and there is no unbeliever.
40|26|And Pharaoh said that I kill Moses and let his Lord be called.
40|27|Moses said that I was hoping for my Lord and your Lord from every old woman who does not believe in the day of the account
40|28|A believer man from the family of Pharaoh said that he will be killed by his faith. He 😂 And if you are honest, some who prepare you?
40|29|O people of you, the king, on the day He guided
40|30|And he who believed, O people, said that I fear for you like the day of the parties
40|31|Likewise
40|32|O people, I am afraid of you on the day of support
40|33|The day you will be tweeted as God is from God
40|34|And Joseph has come to you before the evidence, so you are still in doubt from what came to you. He who is a punctuated person
40|35|Those who argue in the signs of God, without the authority of them, have come to them.
40|36|And Pharaoh said, O Haman, a son of me.
40|37|The causes of the heavens, so I looked at the God of Moses, and I do not think it is false. I want only in dust
40|38|And he who believed in, O people, follow your guidance, the path of guidance
40|39|O people, but this life is the enjoyment
40|40|Whoever does a bad, then it is not permissible except for the same.
40|41|And the people of what I have invited you to the survivor and call me to the fire
40|42|You invite me to disbelieve in God and share with him what I have no knowledge, and I invite you to the dear, forgiveness
40|43|There is no crime that you call me to him, there is no call for him in this world, nor in the hereafter, and that we turned back to God, and that the wicked people are
40|44|You will remember what I say to you ۚ and I delegate my command to God ۚ God is insightful with worshipers
40|45|So God met him bad deeds.
40|46|The fire will be exposed to it, and on the day, the hour will enter, enter the family of Pharaoh, the most severe torment
40|47|And when they need in the fire, he says the weakness of those who arrogate, but we were for you, so if you are sinners from us
40|48|He said those who have been arrogant, for all of them are that God has ruled among the servants
40|49|And those in the fire said to the treasury of hell, invite your Lord to relieve us on the day of the torment
40|50|"They said, ""Will you not come to you, your messengers with the evidence?"""
40|51|We will support our messengers and those who believe in this worldly life and the day will be
40|52|The day the unjust does not benefit from their excuses.
40|53|And Moses Al -Huda came to us and we inherited the children of the Book
40|54|Haddah and remembrance of my first heart
40|55|So be patient, the promise of God is a right and forgiven your guilt, and praised the praise of your Lord with the east and the hearts
40|56|For those who argue in the signs of God, without the authority of them, I have come to them ۙ If in their breasts, they are not the oldest of what they are in the language of the ritual.
40|57|To create the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of people, but more people do not know
40|58|And the blindness, visionary, and those who believed and do righteous deeds, and not
40|59|The hour is coming, there is no doubt in it, but the most people do not believe in
40|60|"And your Lord said, ""Call me,"" I will answer you ۚ that those who arrogate from my worshipers will enter the hell of the people."
40|61|God, who made you the night for you to dwell in it and the day is insightful ۚ God is the best of people for people, but there is a lot of people
40|62|God, your Lord, is a creator of everything
40|63|Likewise, those who were the revelations of God will be exalted
40|64|God, who made you the earth as a decision and the sky is a construction, and your portrayal of you is good, and your perception is better Yen
40|65|He is the neighborhood, no god but He is, so he called him the one who has the religion of the religion.
40|66|Say that I have forbidden to worship those who prayed without God when the evidence came from me from my Lord, and I commanded that I peace to the Lord of the Lord
40|67|He is the one who created you from the dust, then from a sperm, then from the consequences, then it will bring you a ritual, then you will be overwhelmed Les 😂 And let them notify
40|68|He is the one who lives and dies 😂 So if he spends an order, then he says to him, so be
40|69|Did you not see those who argue in the signs of God, that they will be disbelieving
40|70|Those who lied to the book, and what we sent to us, our messengers.
40|71|As the majority in their sins and the sitting are clouded
40|72|In Hamm, then in the fire, they will be recorded
40|73|Then it was said to them wherever you were to share
40|74|"Without God, they said, ""They gone out of us, but we were not calling from anything before anything."""
40|75|That is what you were happy with the earth, without the truth, and what you were happy
40|76|Enter the doors of hell in it.
40|77|So be patient, that the promise of God is a right ۚ So, but we see you some of whom we promise or destroy you, so we will return to us
40|78|And we have sent a messenger from you from them from them who we have shown you and some of them who did not get to you The passage of God was judged by the truth and lost the invalid
40|79|God, who made you the pour of you to ride from them and from them you eat
40|80|And you have benefits in it, and they will be overwhelmed by a need in your breasts, and on the authority of the ark, you can carry
40|81|And show you his signs, for which the signs of God are denying
40|82|Did they not walk in the land and see how the punishment of those who were before them ۚ They were more than them They are captive
40|83|When their messengers came to them with the evidence, they rejoiced with what they have of knowledge and attached to them what they were mocking
40|84|When they saw us, they said, “We believed in God alone, and disbelieved us from what we were partners.
40|85|They did not benefit their faith when they saw us.
41|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
41|2|A download from the Most Merciful
41|3|A book whose signs were separated by an Arabic Qur’an for people who know
41|4|Bush and warning, so they exposed their most, so they do not hear
41|5|And they said our hearts are in what you call us and in our ears a revelation, and among us and among you is a veil, so we do so
41|6|Say: I am a human being like you, it is revealed to me, but God, God is one, so straighten it to Him and seek forgiveness from God
41|7|Those who do not pay zakat and they are the hereafter they are unbelievers
41|8|Those who believe and do righteous deeds have a reward that is not the same.
41|9|Say: You will disbelieve in the one who created the earth on two days and you will make it a dedication to him ۚ That Lord of the worlds
41|10|And he made it in it from the authority and your righteousness in it, and its strengths were appreciated in the four days of the families of the families
41|11|Then he was equal to the sky, and it is a smoke, so he said to her, and for the earth, they came to be voluntary or hatred.
41|12|So they spent seven heavens on two days and revealed in every sky of her command.
41|13|If they are exposed, say, I will warn you a thunder
41|14|When the messengers came to them from their hands and from their successors, they would not worship except God. It is
41|15|As for the one who returned, they arrogated in the land, without the truth, and they said: Whoever is more powerful from us. I am
41|16|So we sent a wind on them in the days of people, so that we can tree them with the torment of the treasury in the life of this world.
41|17|As for the thorns, we guided them, so they loved the blind to the guidance, so I took them as a thunderbolt
41|18|We saved us who believed and they feared
41|19|On the day, the enemies of God will be gathered to the fire, so they will be distributed
41|20|Until what they came, they will be heard, their eyesight, and their vocals for what they were doing
41|21|And they said to them, for whom you have witnessed us.
41|22|And you did not seek to testify to you, nor do you see you, nor your hearts, but you think that God does not know
41|23|And for you, you who thought of your Lord, I want you, so you became from the losers
41|24|If they are patient, the fire is a matter
41|25|And we have been given to them by the two centuries, so they decorated for them what is between them Rin
41|26|And those who disbelieved said: Do not hear for this Qur’an and singing in it, so that you may be overpowered
41|27|Let us give those who disbelieved with severe torment, and let them make them happy who were doing
41|28|That is the reward of the numbers of God, the fire.
41|29|And those who disbelieved, our Lord, who showed us those who were misled by jinn and mankind, will make them under our old
41|30|For those who said, our Lord, God, then righteousness, you will be revealed to them.
41|31|We are the first of you in this worldly life and in the hereath
41|32|A descent from a merciful forgiveness
41|33|And whoever is the best saying of those who called to God and did righteousness and said that I am from the Muslims
41|34|And the good is not equal, nor is the bad ۚ Pay in the one who is better, then if it is between you and between it, it is an enemy, as if it is a mother.
41|35|And what they throw except those who have been patient and what they receive except with great luck
41|36|As for the Satan, we will be broken down, so seek help from God.
41|37|And from his signs at night, day, sun, and moon, do not prostrate to the sun, nor for the moon, and prostrate to God who created it
41|38|If you are arrogant, then those with your Lord praise Him for the night and the day, and they do not believe.
41|39|And from his signs that you see the earth as humble, then when we descend upon it, the water is divided and raised.
41|40|إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي آيَاتِنَا لَا يَخْفَوْنَ عَلَيْنَا ۗ أَفَمَنْ يُلْقَىٰ فِي النَّارِ خَيْرٌ أَمْ مَنْ يَأْتِي آمِنًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۚ اعْمَلُوا مَا شِئْتُمْ ۖ إِنَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ
41|41|Those who disbelieve in remembrance of what they came to them ۖ and it is a dear book
41|42|The falsehood does not come to him from his hands, nor from his successor.
41|43|What is said to you except what was said to the messengers before you ۚ Your Lord is forgiven
41|44|And if we had made it a Qur’an, they would not have said that it would not be the revelations of his signs. In their ears, a revelation, and it is a blind
41|45|And Moses came to us, so he would have disagreed with it ۗ and if there was no word that preceded you
41|46|Whoever does righteousness, let us find it.
41|47|To him, the knowledge of the hour is returned ۚ and what is left out of the fruits No witness
41|48|And what they were calling from before.
41|49|The man does not give up the supplication
41|50|And if we have given it a mercy from us after the harm of it We are the ones who disbelieve in what they have done, and let them be tired of great torment
41|51|And if we are blessed with man, it is exposed, and we come to the side of it, and when evil touches it, then the supplication of a sickness
41|52|Say: I saw that if it was from God, then you disbelieved in it who is more than one who is in a distant discord
41|53|We will show them our verses in the horizons and in their own, until they show them that it is the truth.
41|54|No, they are in a bitterness from the meeting of their Lord.
42|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
42|2|Bench
42|3|Like you, it is revealed to you and to those who are before you, the dear, the wise
42|4|He has what is in the heavens, and what is on the earth.
42|5|The heavens almost break their fast ۚ And the angels praise the praise of their Lord and seek forgiveness from the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one
42|6|And those who took from it without the guardians of God, they are kept on them, and what you are on them with a agent
42|7|Likewise, we have revealed to you a Qur’an, to warn the mother of the villages, and those around them, and you will be warned on the day
42|8|And if God wills, he would make them one nation, but he will enter whoever he wants in his mercy ۚ and the shadows of what they have, and the one who is a guardian.
42|9|Or did they take from him without him.
42|10|And what you have disagreed with something in it, then his judgment is to God ۚ God, my Lord, upon him be upon you
42|11|So the heavens of the heavens and the earth ۚ He made you from your souls, wives, and from the ritual rituals, the wives of the wilds of you ه
42|12|He has the arrests of the heavens and the earth.
42|13|You have started from the debt of what was commanded by Noah, and we have revealed to you Where are you calling them to him ۚ God will give him to whom He wills and guide him to whom he will
42|14|And they did not separate them except for what the knowledge came to them in terms of them. After them, there is a suspicion
42|15|So, so let him call ۖ and take up as you commanded, and you will not follow their whims. الالالالالالالارية We are our deeds and for you your deeds
42|16|And those who argue with God after what their Hajj has responded to, with their Lord, with their Lord, and they have anger, and they have a severe torment
42|17|God, who has revealed the book with the truth and the balance ۗ and what he realizes to perhaps the hour is close
42|18|Those who do not believe in it will hurry with it ۖ and those who believe in separation from them and know that they are the truth, but those who are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who does not
42|19|God is kind to His servants, he will give those who will. He is the dear strong
42|20|Whoever wants to plow the hereafter will increase it in his plow ^ And whoever wants the plow of this world, we will give it from it and what is in the last of the last
42|21|Or do they have partners who have been granted to them from the religion that God did not give permission to them.
42|22|You see the oppressors who are separated from what they have caught, and they are fell on them. It is the great preference
42|23|That is the one who preaches to God who believed in the righteous and the righteous deeds ۗ Say: I do not ask you It is good in it ۚ God is forgiving
42|24|Or do they say that God is false, for God, if God will be concluded on your heart ۗ and God is the falsehood of the false
42|25|And he is the one who accepts the repentance of his worshipers and pardoned the misfortunes and knows what you do
42|26|And those who believe and do righteous deeds and increase them from his grace ۚ and the disbelievers have a severe torment
42|27|And if God is the same as the sustenance of His servants, they would have been in the land, but it is revealed with the amount of what he wants.
42|28|And he is the one who descends the height after what they have been cracked and spread his mercy ۚ and he is the guardian
42|29|And from his signs of the creation of the heavens and the earth, and what has been broadcast in them from the doll ۚ and it is on their collection when it is destroyed.
42|30|And what happened to you from a calamity, as you have earned your hands and pardoned a lot.
42|31|And what you are in my miracle in the land ۖ and what you have without God, and no supporter
42|32|And among his signs is the neighboring in the sea, such as the knowledge
42|33|If he lives, the wind will be relieved, then he will be sure of his back.
42|34|Or they will meet them with what they have earned and pardoned a lot
42|35|And know those who argue in our signs of what they have.
42|36|So what you have given up from something, the enjoyment of this worldly life. What is good for God and the best of those who believe in and for their Lord
42|37|And those who are avoided as the pipes of oscilization and the thorns
42|38|And those who responded to their Lord and resided in the prayers and their command is a consultation between them and what we have agreed upon
42|39|And those who are afflicted by the prostitute, they are victorious
42|40|A bad part of it is like it ۖ Whoever pardoned and reconciled, reward him for God ۚ He does not love the unjust
42|41|And for those who are victorious after his injustice, then those who have to do so
42|42|The path is for those who oppress people and overwhelm the earth, without the truth.
42|43|And whoever is patient and forgive
42|44|And whoever is misled by God, what he has from his guardian after him ۗ and see those who are unjust when they saw the torment they say, are they to a ritual
42|45|And you see that they are subjected to the humiliation of the humiliation ۗ No, those who are unjust are in a valuable torment
42|46|And what they had from the guardians, they would support them without God
42|47|Repent to your Lord before a day comes to him from God ۚ What you have in the day
42|48|For if they are exposed, then we will send you a warm up. Her hands have come, for man is as disbelief
42|49|God has the king of the heavens and the earth ۚ He creates whatever he wants ۚ He gives to whomever He wants a feminine and give to whom the masculinity wills
42|50|Or they marry them with male and female.
42|51|And it would have been a good time that God spoke to him except for a living or from the back of the veil or the sending of a messenger, and he will be revealed by his permission.
42|52|Likewise, we have revealed to you a spirit of our command. A straight step
42|53|The path of God, who has what is in the heavens, and what is on the earth.
43|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
43|2|And the written book
43|3|We made it an Arabic Qur’an, so that you may be reasonable.
43|4|And in the mother of the book, we have a wise
43|5|Memory is overwhelmed by you, as you are a sophisticated people.
43|6|And how many of our Prophets sent in the first two
43|7|And what comes to them from a prophet, but they were mocking it
43|8|So we are more strong than them.
43|9|And if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth to say that they created them, the dear, the knowledgeable
43|10|He who made the earth to you as a shift and made you a way for you to be guided
43|11|And that he descended from the sky with an amount, so we spread it with a dead country.
43|12|And that created all the wives and made you from the ark and the insult to you
43|13|To seek it on his appearance, then remember the grace of your Lord, when you are equal to him and say, Glory be to him, who is a mockery, and he is not.
43|14|And to our Lord, to the two people
43|15|And make him part of his worshipers.
43|16|Or take from what creates daughters and describes you with sons
43|17|And when one of them preached what was beaten for the mercy, the same is a shadow, and it is a shadow
43|18|Or who is created in the sweetness and is in the dignity, it is not clear.
43|19|And make the angels who are the servants of the Most Merciful.
43|20|And they said that if the mercy will be what we worshi
43|21|Or did we come to them as a book before him, so they would be held by him
43|22|Rather, they said: We found our fathers on a nation, and we have their effects
43|23|Likewise, what we have sent before you in a village from a vow, except that they said, “We have found our fathers on a nation, and they are a nation.
43|24|He said, even if I came to you with the guidance of what you have found your fathers.
43|25|So we resided from them.
43|26|And when Abraham said to his father and his people, I am innocent of what you worship
43|27|Except for those who break me, he will guide me
43|28|He made it a word that remains in its hill.
43|29|Rather, I used to be the ones and their fathers until the truth and a clear Messenger came
43|30|And when the truth came to them, they said this is magic, and we are unbelieving.
43|31|And they said, Were it not for us to send this Qur’an on a man from the two villages
43|32|They divide your mercy I have mercy on your Lord is better than what they are
43|33|And if only people would be a single nation, we would have made us for those who disbelieve in mercy for their homes
43|34|And their cores are doors, and they are pleased with them.
43|35|Dakhir ۚ And that all of you are the enjoyment of this life.
43|36|And whoever lives from the remembrance of Rahman, we will be able to have a Satan, then he has two centuries
43|37|And they will repeat them from the way and calculate that they are guided
43|38|Until, when we came, he said: Oh, between me and between you, the distant of the two signs, then the misery of the two villages
43|39|Today, you will not benefit you, when you wronged that you are in the torment.
43|40|Did you hear the deaf or guide the blindness, and whoever is in a clear delusion
43|41|So, we go to you, for you are righteous
43|42|Or we see you, which we have prepared for them, for you are fought
43|43|So you seek to you who inspired you to you. You are a straight path
43|44|And it is a remembrance for you and your people.
43|45|And ask those who sent us before you from our messengers. We have made us without mercy.
43|46|And Moses sent us with our verses to Pharaoh and filled him, so he said that I am the Messenger of the Lord of the two worlds
43|47|When they came to them with our verses, if they are laughing
43|48|And what we show them from a verse, except that it is greater than her sister.
43|49|And they said: O magician
43|50|When we revealed the torment of them, if they are
43|51|And Pharaoh called in his people, he said, O people
43|52|Or I am better than this, which is a humiliation and hardly shows
43|53|If not for him to be thrown from a golden or a gap, or the angels came with him
43|54|So his people were afraid and obeyed him ۚ They were a good people
43|55|When we regretted us, we resided from them, and we immersed them all.
43|56|So we made them a predecessor and an example for the last
43|57|And when the son of Mary was crushed, for example, when your people are from him, they will sing
43|58|And they said, our gods are better, or they are ۚ What they have set for you except for a new one.
43|59|If it is only a servant, we have been blessed with it and made it an example for the sons of Israel
43|60|And if we would have made us an angel in the land, they will be left.
43|61|And it is a knowledge for the hour, so you will not be passed on to it and follow it ۚ This is a straight path
43|62|And the Satan does not believe you. It is a clear enemy
43|63|And when Issa came with the evidence, he said, I came to you with wisdom, and to show you some of those who have disagreed with it, and they will be lost.
43|64|God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him ۚ This is a straight path
43|65|The parties differed from among them 😂 Fawal to those who wronged from the torment of a day
43|66|Do they look only for the hour to come to them, and they do not feel
43|67|Evil Thursday, some of them are for some enemy except those who are righteous
43|68|O servants, there is no fear for you today, and you are not grieving
43|69|Those who believed in our verses and were Muslims
43|70|Enter Paradise, you and your wives
43|71|They are circumcised with a drink of gold and curtains.
43|72|And that is the paradise you inherited by what you were doing
43|73|You have a lot of fruits from which you eat
43|74|The criminals are in the torment of hell, immortal
43|75|They are not lost, and they are in it.
43|76|And we did not oppress them, but they were the oppressors
43|77|And you called, O Malik, to destroy your Lord.
43|78|We have come to you with the truth, but I have many for the truth.
43|79|Or do they honor an order, then we are happy
43|80|Or do they calculate that we do not hear their secret and their successes ۚ Blom and our messengers have to write
43|81|Say that if the mercy has a son, then I am the first of the slaves
43|82|Glory be to the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, Lord of the Throne.
43|83|So their attempts to go through and play until they meet their day, which they promise
43|84|And he is the one who is in the sky of God and in the earth, God is the wise and knowledgeable
43|85|And the king of the heavens and the earth and what is between them and has the knowledge of the time
43|86|And those who call from them without the intercession do not possess
43|87|While I asked them of their creation closer to Allaah How then Aavkon
43|88|And his saying, O Lord, is that they are people who do not believe
43|89|So he forgave them and say peace ۚ So they know
44|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
44|2|And the written book
44|3|We sent it on a blessed night ۚ We were warnings
44|4|It separates every wise matter
44|5|A matter of us ۚ We were messengers
44|6|Merciful from your Lord ۚ He is the Hearing of the Knowledgeable
44|7|Lord of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them.
44|8|There is no god but He will revive and die.
44|9|Rather, they are in doubt
44|10|So the day will take the day to come with a clear smoke
44|11|People are cheated on this painful torment
44|12|Our Lord, reveal the torment of us, but we are believers
44|13|I have the remembrance, and they have come to a clear Messenger
44|14|Then they took care of him and said a teacher of crazy
44|15|We will heal the torment a little.
44|16|The day we are overwhelmed by the old
44|17|And we have lost before them the people.
44|18|To lead me to the worshipers of God.
44|19|And that you do not rise to God.
44|20|And I am hoping for my Lord and your Lord to be tone
44|21|And if you do not believe in me, you will be disgraced
44|22|His Lord called that this people are criminals
44|23|So I am pleased with my servants, at night, you are followed
44|24|And the sea will be left.
44|25|How much they left from the paradise and eyes?
44|26|And a generous custodian and a place
44|27|And a blessing in which they were fruits
44|28|Your liars ۖ and we inherited it as another people
44|29|So what the sky and the earth grabbed them, and they were not the eyes of
44|30|And we have saved the children
44|31|From Pharaoh ۚ He was high
44|32|We have seen them on the knowledge of the worlds
44|33|And we came from the verses in which there is no clear welfare
44|34|This is what they say
44|35|If it is only our first death, and what we are spreading
44|36|So come with our fathers if you are true
44|37|They are the best or a people who are followed and those who are before them ۚ We have their people.
44|38|And we did not create the heavens and the earth, and what are among them are players
44|39|We did not create them except with the truth, but many of them do not know
44|40|The day of separation is all of them
44|41|A day does not enrich my money from the money, and they are not victorious
44|42|إِلَّا مَنْ رَحِمَ اللَّهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ
44|43|The tree of the ritual
44|44|The food of the wealthy
44|45|Like the vigor, it is overwhelmed
44|46|Keeli Al -Hamim
44|47|Take it, so they took it up to the hell
44|48|Then they poured down his head from the torment
44|49|You are the dear, the generous
44|50|This is what you were going through
44|51|The righteous in a safe place
44|52|In the gardens
44|53|They are dressed in a bond, and a consecutive argument.
44|54|Your liars and promoted them with an eye
44|55|They invite them with all safe fruits
44|56|They do not taste the death except the first dead ^ And the torment of hell is kept them
44|57|Fadl from your Lord ۚ That is the great winner
44|58|Rather, we are pleased with your tongue, so that they may remember
44|59|So they are received
45|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
45|2|Download the Book from God, the dear, wise
45|3|In the heavens and the earth, there are signs for the believers
45|4|And in your creation, and what is transmitted from the signs of people who are certain.
45|5|And let the night and day be overlooked, and what God has revealed from the sky from a liveli
45|6|Those are the verses of God, we recite it to you with the truth.
45|7|Woe to every sinful frustration
45|8|He hears the signs of God, followed upon him, then he will be an arrogant, as if he did not hear it 😂 So he preached it with a painful torment
45|9|And if he knew from our signs something that you take as a shake ۚ Those have a humiliating torment
45|10|From their life, Hell ۖ and I do not enrich them from what they have earned something, nor what they took from God without God, and they have a great torment
45|11|This is guided ^ And those who disbelieved in the verses of their Lord have a torment of a painful impression
45|12|God, who mocked you for the sea to run the ark in it with his command, and seek to be of grace, and perhaps you will thank you
45|13|And he was harnessed for you in the heavens and what is on the earth is all of it ۚ in that there are signs of people who think
45|14|Say to those who believe, forgive those who do not hope for the days
45|15|Whoever does righteousness, let him himself ^ And whoever is offended to do it 😂 Then to your Lord, you will return
45|16|And we have come to the children of the Book, the ruling, and the prophecy, and we have given them the good things, and we preferred them over the worlds
45|17|And we came to them between the matter of the matter.
45|18|Then we made you a project of the matter, so follow it, and do not follow the whims of those who do not know
45|19|They will not enrich you from God ۚ And those who are unjust are some of them.
45|20|This is a way for people, guidance and mercy for people who are certain.
45|21|Or did those who have expressed the bad things that we make them like those who believed and did the righteous, whether they are their lives and their deaths.
45|22|And God created the heavens and the earth with the truth, and to reward every soul with what they have earned, and they do not oppress
45|23|You have seen someone who took God, and God has gone to him, and he has given his hearing and his hearts, and he made him from his heart. They remember
45|24|And they said: What are the life of this world, we will die and we live, and what is destroyed by us except the forefathers ۚ and what they have with the knowledge of God.
45|25|And when our signs are shown on them, their pilgrims were not their pilgrimage except if they said, come with our fathers, if you are true
45|26|Say: God bless you, then he will die for you, and then he will be gathered to you to the Day of Resurrection.
45|27|And to God the King of Heavens and the Earth ۚ and the day when the hour will be established on the day
45|28|And every nation is seen ۚ Every nation is called to its book on the day they are rewarded for what you were doing
45|29|This is our book
45|30|As for those who believed and do righteous deeds, their Lord will enter them in his mercy ۚ That is the wild out
45|31|As for those who disbelieved, did you not know my signs.
45|32|And when it is said that the promise of God is a right and the hour is not a doubt in it, you say what we know what the hour is if we think that we do not think that we do not think
45|33|And they had bad things for what they did and attached to them what they were mocking.
45|34|And it was said today, as we forget you as you forgot to meet your day, this and the goodness of the fire
45|35|That is that you have taken the signs of God a shake, and the life of this world is deceived
45|36|May God bless the Lord of the Heavens and the Lord of the earth, Lord of the Worlds
45|37|And he has the greatness in the heavens and the earth.

46|3|We did not create the heavens and the earth, and what is between them except with the truth and the name of the name ۚ and those who disbelieved in what they warned
46|4|Say: You have seen what you call from God without God Come on
46|5|And whoever is more than those who call from God who does not respond to him to the Day of Resurrection, and they are on their prayers.
46|6|And if people are raised, they have enemies and they were their servants as disbelievers
46|7|And when our signs are shown on them, the evidence of those who disbelieved to the truth when they came to them, this is a clear magic
46|8|Or do they say that he fascinated him ۖ Say that I will not have anything to do with God Em
46|9|Say what I was a heresy from the messenge
46|10|Say: I saw that if it was from God, and you disbelieved in it, and witnessed a witness from the children
46|11|And those who disbelieved said to those who believe, if it was better than what we have preceded to him ۚ And when they were not guided by it, they would say this
46|12|And before him, the book of Moses, an imam and mercy.
46|13|Those who said, our Lord, God, then righteousness, are not afraid of them, nor are they grieving

48|29|Muhammad, the Messenger of God ۚ and those with whom the most disbelievers are the most merciful between them. From the impact of the prostration ۚ That is the same in the Torah ۚ and their example in the Najil is as a cultivation that brings it out. To be angry with the disbelievers ۗAnd God promised those who believed and did the righteous of them, forgiveness and great reward
49|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
49|2|O you who believe, do not raise your voices, according to the voice of the Prophet, and do not make it more Arab
49|3|Those who hate their voices at the Messenger of God are those who are the ones who have come to God for their hearts to piety and forgive them
49|4|Those who call you from the backs of the stone are the most of them.
49|5|And if they were patient until they were brought out to them, it would be better for them ۚ And God is Forgiving, Most Merciful
49|6|O you who believe, if you come to you, then be a good news, and you will see that you will be afflicted
49|7|And know that the Messenger of God is in you. The market and the disobedience ۚ Those are the people.
49|8|Fadl from God and a blessing ۚ And God is a wise knowledge
49|9|And if two sects are among the believers, they are killed, and they are reconciled between them. If you come up, then reconcile them with justice and take over.
49|10|But the believers are brothers, so they reconciled between your brothers ۚ and fear God, so that you may be merciful

49|14|The Arabs said: We have not believed, but we said, and when we enter faith in your heart ۚ God is Forgiving, Most Merciful
49|15|But the believers who believe in God and His Messenger, then they did not repent and strive for their money and their soul
49|16|Say: Do you know God with your religion
49|17|They wish you to convert to Islam. Say: Do not wish you peace
49|18|God knows the absence of the heavens and the earth.
50|1|In the name of God, the Merciful, the Most Merciful.
50|2|Rather, they wondered that they were warned of them, so the disbelievers said this is a strange thing
50|3|If we died and we are dust
50|4|We have learned what the earth decreases from them ۖ and we have a memorial book
50|5|Rather, they lied to the truth, when they came to them, so they were in a matter.
50|6|Did they not look at the sky above them, how are they built it and decorated it and what it has from the eruption
50|7|And the land we have given it and we gave us my souls and we have reported to it from every husband with a joy
50|8|Increase and remembrance of every good servant
50|9|And we descended from the sky with a blessed water, so we have spoken to him with paradise and love of the harvest
50|10|And the palm tree with it
50|11|Give the worshipers ۖ and revive us with a dead country
50|12|The people of Noah, the companions of the Ras, and the Ras, lied to them.
50|13|Update, and the two people, and the brothers of Lot
50|14|And the owners of the iyah and the people are followed ۚ Every lied to the messengers and a long time
50|15|We are aware of the first creation.
50|16|We have created man and we know what it is whose soul
50|17|When the two are received from the Yemeni and the Shamal al -Shamal, it
50|18|What is said of a saying, except for him, is a steadfast seed.
50|19|The drunkenness of death came with the truth 😂 That is what you were neutralized
50|20|And he was blown in pictures ۚ That day
50|21|And it came all the same with the driver and a witness
50|22|You have been in a mistake from this, so we revealed your cover for you, and your eyesight today is a limit
50|23|And his two villages said this is what I have been
50|24|Cast into hell every Kfar stubborn
50|25|A good manner
50|26|He who has made God to God is another, and he gave Him in the severe torment
50|27|His two villages said our Lord, what I wanted, but it was in a distance after
50|28|I do not Takhtsamua I have provided to you Baloaid
50|29|What will change and what I have to say I am darkness of slaves
50|30|On the day we say that he will be filled and say, is it more than more?
50|31|Paradise was destroyed for the righteous, not far away
50|32|This is what you promise to all the abandonment of
50|33|Whoever fears the mercy in the unseen and came with a close heart
50|34|Enter them with peace.
50|35|They have what they want, and our religion is more
50|36|And how many of us are before them from a century, they are more severe than them.
50|37|In that, it is mentioned for those who have a heart or a hearing, and he is a martyr
50|38|And we created the heavens and the earth, and what is between them in six days and what we have touched
50|39|So be patient with what they say and praise the praise of your Lord before the sun was brought up and before the stranger
50|40|And from the night, he praised him and the wardrobes of prostration
50|41|And he tolerates the day of the supporter of a close place
50|42|The day they hear the swallow of the right ۚ That day
50|43|Verily We salute us and were grown and determination
50|44|The day of the earth will be stolen from them in speed.
50|45|We know what they say ۖ and what you are on them with a membrium.
51|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
51|2|Writings are a vocal
51|3|The female maids are easy
51|4|The division is an order
51|5|Rather, you promise to be true
51|6|And religion is a reality
51|7|And the sky with love
51|8|You have a different saying
51|9|It is for you to be reluctant
51|10|Al -Aksoun was killed
51|11|Those who are in a thumb
51|12|They ask where the day of religion
51|13|The day they are on fire
51|14|Taste your affection, this is what you were hurrying to hurry
51|15|The righteous in the paradise and eyes
51|16|Take what their Lord gave them ۚ They were before that, good.
51|17|They were a little at night
51|18|And with the magicians, they seek forgiveness
51|19|And in their money is a right of the misery and the mihrab
51|20|And in the land there are signs of those who are certain
51|21|and in your selves, do you not see
51|22|In the sky the uterus or grave
51|23|The Lord of Heaven and Earth
51|24|Did you have the hadith
51|25|When they entered upon him and said, peace be upon him.
51|26|He emptied to his family, and he came with a hurry
51|27|"So he said to them, he said, ""Do you not eat?"""
51|28|"So they were afraid of them ۖ They said, ""Do not be afraid."" And preach it with knowledge"
51|29|So I accepted his wife in a bitter
51|30|They said that your Lord said: He is the wise, knowledgeable
51|31|He said: What do you think of you, the messengers
51|32|They said: We sent us to the people of criminals
51|33|Let us send a stone on them
51|34|Supported by your Lord for the Persons
51|35|So we were brought out to those who were among the believers
51|36|What we found in it is not a house of Muslims
51|37|And we have left a sign for those who fear the painful torture
51|38|And Moses, when we sent him to Pharaoh with a clear authority
51|39|He took care of his knife and said a magician or a madman
51|40|So we took it and his soldiers, so we rejected them in the day, and it is a domain
51|41|And in Upha, when we sent them the sterile wind
51|42|What is alarmed from something that came to him except that you have made it like the pillar
51|43|And in the same time, when they were told, they enjoyed until time.
51|44|They raised from the command of their Lord, so the thunderbolt took them and they looked
51|45|So what they resorted to resurrection, and they were not victorious
51|46|Noah came before.
51|47|And the sky we built with hands, and we are expanders
51|48|And the land we spread it.
51|49|And from everything we have created two wives, you may remember
51|50|Far
51|51|And do not make another god with God.
51|52|As well as those who came before them from a messenger, except they said a magician or a madman
51|53|Take it with it.
51|54|So she was on them
51|55|Remember, the remembrance of the believers is the benefit of the believers
51|56|And I did not create jinn and mankind except to worship
51|57|What I want from them is a livelihood, and what I want to feed
51|58|God is the sustenance of the two powerful power
51|59|For those who have injustice to the sins like the sins of their companions, do not hurry
51|60|Fawal for those who disbelieved from their day who are promising
52|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
52|2|And a simple book
52|3|In a publication
52|4|And the optimistic house
52|5|And the purposeful stance
52|6|And the migrant sea
52|7|The torment of your Lord is a reality
52|8|What he has from a motivation
52|9|The day of the sky is a light
52|10|The mountains are easy
52|11|Fawal, then to the lies
52|12|Those who are in a man who are playing
52|13|The day they call for the fire
52|14|This is the fire that you were lying
52|15|Is this?
52|16|Ask it, be patient, or do not patience with you.
52|17|The righteous in paradise and nurses
52|18|So they are what their Lord gave them and their Lord has been kept them.
52|19|Eat and drink here what you were doing
52|20|Recommended on a muddy bed and married them with an eye of eyes
52|21|And those who believed and followed their offspring with faith, we have their offspring and their offspring, and what we have given them from their work.
52|22|And we expanded them with frustration and flesh from what they desire
52|23|They are disputed in it as a good, and there is no sin in it, nor is it sinful
52|24|And they are flooded with them, as if they were a place.
52|25|And accept each other wondering
52|26|They said that we were before our family.
52|27|From God, to us and protect us with the torment of the poison
52|28|We were before we invite him. He is the merciful righteousness
52|29|So remember, and when you were blessed by your Lord with a priest and no madness
52|30|Or do they say a poet, we will wait for the Lord of the sinner
52|31|Say: Look, for I am from you
52|32|Or do their dreams command them with this ۚ or are they people who are overwhelmed
52|33|Or do they say you say it ۚ but do not believe
52|34|Let them come with a hadith like it if they are true
52|35|Or created by nothing, or are they the creators
52|36|Or they created the heavens and the earth.
52|37|Or do they have the cabinets of your Lord, or they are the ones
52|38|Or do they have a ladder who listens to it in it.
52|39|Or has the daughters, and for you the children
52|40|Or do you ask them for a reward, they are a minor.
52|41|Or they have the unseen, they write
52|42|Or do they want a good?
52|43|Or do God have God other than God ۚ Glory be to God.
52|44|And if they see a fracture of the sky, they would say a dumb cloud.
52|45|So their attempts to meet their day in which they are stunned
52|46|A day that does not enrich them with anything, and they are not victorious
52|47|And for those who have unjustly torture without that, but many do not know
52|48|And be patient with the judgment of your Lord, for you are helping us.
52|49|And from the night, he praised him and the tanning of the stars
53|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
53|2|What is your friend lost
53|3|And what is in love with the passion
53|4|It is only a Revelation revealed
53|5|Shadid Al -Qudah taught him
53|6|It is a time
53|7|It is the highest horizon
53|8|Then we have become amended
53|9|It was just around the corner
53|10|So he referred to his servant what he revealed
53|11|What a lie heart what he saw
53|12|Do you pass it on what he sees
53|13|And he saw it as another descending
53|14|When Sidra Al -Manta
53|15|The paradise of the mine
53|16|When the bad is cheated on what he cheats
53|17|The eyesight is not overwhelmed and what is overwhelmed
53|18|He has seen from the signs of his great Lord
53|19|Did you see the laat and the comfort?
53|20|And the goodness of the other third
53|21|You are the male, and he has the female
53|22|That is a visible division
53|23|إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنْتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُمْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الْأَنْفُسُ ۖ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُمْ مِنْ رَبِّهِمُ الْهُدَىٰ
53|24|Or for man what he wished
53|25|God is the last and the first
53|26|And how many king in the heavens, their intercessors do not enrich anything except that God gives permission to whomever He wills and pleases
53|27|Those who do not believe in the hereafter to name the angels, the name of the female
53|28|And they have no knowledge of it.
53|29|So he exposed to those who took over from our remembrance and only wanted life in this world
53|30|That is what they have been informed of knowledge ۚ If your Lord is the knowledge of those who have gone out of his path and he is the knowledge of those who guided
53|31|And to God in the heavens, and what is on the earth to reward those who worsened what they did and reward those who are good at the good
53|32|Those who are avoided as the pipes of ours The stomachs of your mothers.
53|33|You saw the one who took over
53|34|And give a few and make sure
53|35|He has the knowledge of the unseen, and it is seen
53|36|Or did he not predict what is in Moses newspapers
53|37|And Abraham who has been
53|38|Unless you visit another butter
53|39|And that there is no human being except for what he sought
53|40|And his endeavor is a sword that sees
53|41|Then he is rewarded by the sufficient part
53|42|And that to your Lord, the end
53|43|And he sacrificed you and cried
53|44|And it is the nations and life
53|45|And he created the male and females.
53|46|From a sperm when he hopes
53|47|And that the other creation is upon him
53|48|And he is the song
53|49|And he is the Lord of poetry
53|50|And that your family is the first
53|51|And a whisper, so what remained
53|52|Noah came before before them.
53|53|And the interior
53|54|So they cheated on what he deceived
53|55|So what is your Lord's family
53|56|This is a vow of the first vow
53|57|The wedding was exhausted
53|58|Not have without God revealing
53|59|Do you like this?
53|60|And you laugh, and do not cry
53|61|And you are Samid
53|62|So find God and worship ۩
54|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
54|2|And if they see a verse, they will be exposed and say a continuous magic
54|3|And they lied and followed their whims ۚ and every matter is stable.

58|15|God promised them a severe torment.
58|16|They took their faith as a paradise, and they repelled the path of God, so they have a humiliating torment
58|17|Their money will not be enriched by them, nor their children from God anything ۚ Those are the owners of the fire.
58|18|The day of God will send them all, and they will be solved for him as they swear to you ۖ and they calculate that they are on the authority of them.
58|19|The Satan was embarrassed, so the remembrance of God has forgotten them ۚ Those are the parties of Satan ۚ except that the Satan party is the one
58|20|Those who reiterate God and His Messenger are those in humiliation
58|21|God wrote to the Great I and my messengers ۚ God is a dear strong
58|22|Do not find people who believe in God and the last day they will be destroyed He wrote in their hearts faith and supported them with a spirit of it. Zub Allah ۚNo, the party of God is the successor
59|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

59|5|What you cut from a softness, or left it standing on its origins, then with the permission
59|6|And what God has fulfilled on his Messenger from them, so what you have broken on him from horses, nor passengers, but God is overwhelmed by his messenge
59|7|What God has fulfilled on his Messenger from the people of the villages, to God and the Messenger, and for the kinship, the orphans ۚ And the Messenger did not bring you, then take it, and what He forbade you from it, so they will be lost. ۚ And fear God.
59|8|For the poor who are the ones who have been brought out from their homes and their money, they seek a preference It is
59|9|And those who are the house and the faith before them, they love those who migrated to them And they have a special one ۚ and whoever has the scarcity of himself, then those are the ones.
59|10|And those who came after them, they say our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who have preceded us with faith And Rahim
59|11|Did you not see to those who woke up to say to their brothers who are disbelieved from the people of the book Let us support you, and God will testify that they are liars
59|12|If they go out, they will not come out with them, and if they say, they will not be victorious, and if we support them, they will be fed up.
59|13|You are the most dread in their breasts from God ۚ That is that they are people who do not understand it
59|14|Do not fight all They said

61|5|And when Moses said to his people, O people Yen
61|6|And when Issa, the son of Mary, said, O sons of Israel, that I am the Messenger of God They came to them with evidence, they said this is a clear magic
61|7|And whoever is the most darkened of those who are overwhelmed by God, the liar, and he is called to Islam ۚ and God does not guide the unjust people
61|8|They want to soften the light of God with their affliction

65|10|God promised them a severe torment.
65|11|A messenger who recites the verses of God, indicating that he will come out to those who believe and do righteous deeds from the darkness to the light. The rivers are running under it.

66|5|His Lord, if he divorces you, will replace him with a good wilderness than you are Muslims who believe in the components
66|6|يَا أَيُّهَا ​​الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَارًا وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ عَلَيْهَا مَلَائِكَةٌ غِلَاظٌ شِدَادٌ لَا يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَا أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ
66|7|O you who disbelieved, do not apologize today?
66|8|O you who believe in God In me and those who believed with him ۖ their lights seek between their hands and their faiths, they say our Lord, I will complete us and forgive us and forgive us.
66|9|O Prophet, the guidance of the disbelievers, the hypocrites, and the anger of them ۚ and their mourners are hell.
66|10|God set an example for those who disbelieved a woman, Noah, and you were a lug of Lot. Enter the fire with the inside
66|11|And God set an example for those who believed in a woman, so I said, when the Lord of my son said to me with a house in Paradise Men
66|12|And the daughter of Amran, who fortified her, has broken us in it from our souls and believed the words of her Lord
67|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
67|2|He who created death and life to be blessed with you, which is better
67|3|The one who created seven heavens is a pattern 😂 What you see in the creation of mercy from the fool
67|4|Then return the eyesight two crops that turn to you, the sight is a lighter, and it is a sense
67|5|And we have decorated the worldly sky with the sakes of savings, and we made it as a stomach for the two plaintiffs ۖ and we used to them the torment of the pricing.
67|6|And for those who disbelieved in their Lord, the torment of hell.
67|7|If they are thrown into it, they heard it as a tight, and it is upset
67|8|It is almost distinguished from the angry.
67|9|They said, “We have come to be a vow, so we lied to us, and we said what God has descended from anything.
67|10|And they said if we were listening or rationalizing what we were in the owners of the price
67|11|Farm with their sins, and crushed to the people of the pricing.
67|12|Those who fear their Lord with the unseen have forgiveness and a great reward

67|17|Or do you believe in the sky that you send you a hunger?
67|18|And he lied to those who were before them, so he was a disbeliever
67|19|Will they not see the bird, according to them, and they will hold them.
67|20|So, who is a soldier for you to support you without mercy ۚ The disbelievers are only in vanity
67|21|For this, who gives you your liveli
67|22|Will he walk on his face, I will guide him to walking together on a straight path
67|23|Say: He is the one who created you and made you hearing, visionary, and heartfelt.
67|24|Say: He is the one who has brought you up in the land, and to Him you will be gathered
67|25|And they say when this is a promise if you are true
67|26|Say, but the knowledge is with God, but I am a clear vow
67|27|When they saw him as a wrapp
67|28|Say: You have seen that God is your family
67|29|Say: He is the Most Merciful.
67|30|Say: You have seen if you become a lord
68|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
68|2|You are not the blessing of your Lord with madness
68|3|And if you have a wage, there is no reward
68|4|And you are a great creation
68|5|They see and see
68|6|However, the one who is the one
68|7|Your Lord is the knowledge of those who have gone astray from his path, and he knows the guidance.
68|8|Do not obey the lies
68|9|And if you are fat, they will be painful
68|10|And do not obey every insult
68|11|Humor
68|12|A good manner
68|13|A long time after that Zanim

68|15|If our verses are followed by him, the myths of the first said:
68|16|We will call it on the maximum
68|17|But we showed them as we have the owners of Heaven, when they divided
68|18|And do not exceed
68|19|A group of your Lord has circumcised it, and they are asleep
68|20|So I became like the honesty
68|21|So they supported two mornings
68|22|If you are in your inheritance if you are strict
68|23|So they divorced and they are afraid
68|24|The day will not enter them
68|25|And they went to the burning of two people
68|26|When they saw it, they said: We are lost
68|27|Rather, we are hierarchy
68|28|"They said, ""Will you not tell you if you would not be praised?"""
68|29|They said, Glory be to our Lord.
68|30|Some of them accepted some of them.
68|31|They said: “We are tyrants
68|32|Our Lord is good for us to replace us from it, but to our Lord, they wanted
68|33|The torture of the torment of the hereafter is greater
68|34|For those who fear their Lord the gardens

68|36|Malcolm, how do you judge
68|37|Or do you have a book in which you study

68|44|So you missed me and whoever lies with this hadith 😂 We will study them from where they do not know
68|45|And hope for them ۚ My friend is dead
68|46|Or do you ask them for a reward, they are a minor.
68|47|Or they have the unseen, they write
68|48|So be patient with the rule of your Lord, and it is not like the owner

68|50|His Lord turned him and made him one of the righteous

69|10|They disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord, so they took them as a rap.
69|11|When the water has been overwhelmed by the water, we made you in the neighbor
69|12|Let us make it for you to remind you and fulfill them, conscious ears
69|13|So if we blow in the images one blow
69|14|And the land and the mountains were made, and they destroyed one.
69|15|Then the fall was signed
69|16|And the sky was raised, and it is a day
69|17|And the king is on its hopes ۚ And he carries the throne of your Lord, above them.
69|18|Then you will be hidden from you a fear

69|32|Then in a seil of seventy arm, so they would have it.
69|33|He did not believe in God the Great
69|34|And he does not urge the food of the poor
69|35|For him, there is no protector
69|36|There is no food except for washing
69|37|It only eats it

69|43|Download from the Lord of the Worlds
69|44|And if you would say to us some of the custodians
69|45|Let us take from him in the days
69|46|Then we cut off the two years
69|47|What one of you is a barrier
69|48|And it is a reminder to the righteous

70|2|The disbelievers have no motivation
70|3|From God, who is in practice
70|4|The angels and the spirit were brought to him on a day that was five thousand years old
70|5|Patience with beautiful patience
70|6|They see him distant
70|7|And we see it as a close
70|8|The day will be the sky
70|9|And the mountains are the same
70|10|He does not ask Hammam heated
70|11|They see them ۚ The crowd is if it is possible from the torment of the day in its sons
70|12|And his friend and brother
70|13|And his separation that she lives
70|14|And whoever is on the ground all, then he will succeed
70|15|No, it is a fool
70|16|A conflict for the distress
70|17|Call those who manage and take over
70|18|And he gathered so that
70|19|Man was created by this
70|20|If evil touches it as a reward
70|21|And if the good touches it as a variety
70|22|Except those who pray
70|23|Those who are in their prayers are always
70|24|And those in their money are a knowledgeable right
70|25|For the liquids and the warehouses
70|26|And those who believe in the Day of Religion
70|27|And those who are the torment of their Lord are accompanied
70|28|The torment of their Lord is not safe
70|29|And those who are for their promotions are preserved
70|30|Except for their wives or what their faith has
70|31|So whoever sings and behind that, then those are the habit.
70|32|And those who are for their honesty and their covenant are sponsors
70|33|And those who are in their testimonies
70|34|And those who are on their prayers are kept
70|35|Those are in honorable gardens
70|36|The money of those who disbelieved before you
70|37|On the right of the right and the north
70|38|Each of them is reassured that he enters the paradise of Naim
70|39|No, we created them from what they know
70|40|I do not swear by the Lord of the Magicur.
70|41|We must replace it from them, and what we are in the ways.
70|42|So their attempts to go through and play until they meet their day, which they promise
70|43|Day out of Sraa graves if they were to set Aovdon
70|44|Charging them too much shame downcast eyes that day that they were promised
71|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
71|2|He said, O people
71|3|If God worships, fear Him
71|4|You forgive you from your sins and delay you for a name ۚ if God is when God comes when it comes, it will not be delayed.
71|5|My Lord said that I called my people night and forever
71|6|I did not increase them except a righteous
71|7|And that I called them to forgive them, they made them follow them in their ears, and they were covered with their garments, and they were arrested, and they were arrogant, and they were arrogant
71|8|Then I invited them
71|9|Then I declared them and I was pleased with them.
71|10|So I said forgive your Lord, that he was forgiven
71|11|Heaven sends you in abundance
71|12|And it provides you with money and sons, and it will make you gardens and make you rivers
71|13|You do not hope for God
71|14|He created you
71|15|Did you not see how God created seven aspirations.
71|16|He made the moon in them a light and made the sun as a hole
71|17|By God, your woven from the earth is a prophecy
71|18|Then he will restore you and bring you out.
71|19|And God made you the earth simply
71|20|Let them be wretched from it
71|21|Noah, Lord, said that they disobeyed me and followed those who did not increase his money and his son except a loss
71|22|And they have been old
71|23|"And they said, ""Do not warn your god"
71|24|They have gone a lot.
71|25|From their sin, they were placed, and they entered a fire, and they did not find them without God.
71|26|Noah, Lord, said that the land is not destroyed
71|27|If you warn them, they will mislead you
71|28|Lord, forgive me and the parents of my parents, and whoever enters my house as a believer and the believers and the believers
72|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
72|2|He guides to rationality, and believe in us ۖ and we will not publish you with our Lord
72|3|And it is the Almighty, the grandfather of our Lord, what has taken the owner, nor a child.
72|4|And he used to say, Safeh, on God.
72|5|And I thought that you will not say man and jinn for God as a lie.
72|6|And that he was a man from man
72|7|And they thought as you thought that God will not send anyone
72|8|And I have touched the sky, so we found it filling in a severe and lustful goat.
72|9|And we were falling from it, a bis to the hearing.
72|10|And I do not know the most important I want to those in the land, or I want their Lord to be guided by them
72|11|And we are among us who are good and from that without that.
72|12|And we thought that we will not be miraculous in the earth and we will not be inhabited by
72|13|And when we have heard the guidance, we believed in him?
72|14|And we are among the Muslims, and from us, who are the masters.
72|15|As for the rituals, they were soaked
72|16|And if they resigned on the way, we would have given them a good water.
72|17|We are in it in it ۚ and whoever is exposed to the remembrance of his Lord, he will be tormented by a ritual torment
72|18|And that the mosques are for God, so do not pray with God
72|19|And when the servant of God prayed to him, they would have almost on it.
72|20|Say: I only call my Lord, and I will not share with him anyone
72|21|Say: I do not have you hurt nor rational
72|22|Say: I will not tell me one of God, and I will not find it without it.
72|23|Except a rhetoric from God and his messages ۚ and whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, for He has the fire
72|24|Even if they saw what they promised, they will know who weakens a supporter and less
72|25|Say: If I know the most close to what you are promising, or make my Lord a princess for him
72|26|The scientist of the unseen, so it does not appear on his absence
72|27|Except for those who are satisfied with a messenger, he asks you from his hands and from his successor as a monotheism
72|28|Let them know that they have informed the messages of their Lord, and I surround what they have and counted everything
73|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
73|2|Restle the night except a little
73|3|half or a little bit less
73|4|Or increase the Qur’an and the recitation of the Qur’an
73|5|We will give you a clear saying to you
73|6|The night is more severe and firm.
73|7|In the day, you have a long time
73|8|And remember the name of your Lord, and take over to him
73|9|The Lord of the East and the Maghreb, there is no god but He is taking it as an agent
73|10|And be patient with what they say and make them a beautiful abandonment
73|11|And the first of the grace and the lying are the first of the blessing and their lease.
73|12|We have a healing and healing
73|13|And food with a branch and a painful torture
73|14|The day of the land and the mountains, and the mountain
73|15|We sent a messenger to you, as we have sent us to Pharaoh.
73|16|He disobeyed Pharaoh the Messenger, so we took it as a long time
73|17|How do you fear that if you disbelieve a day, he will make the country a gray.
73|18|The heavens are broken by it ۚ his promise was effective
73|19|This is a remembrance of him 😂 Whoever wants to take to his Lord as a way
73|20|If your Lord knows that you are the lowest of the nights and his half, and a third of those who are with you He repented to you, and read what is easy from the Qur’an ۚ He knows that you will be satisfactory from you ۙ and others will strike in the land of the land of the landThey are fighting in the path of God, so read what is easy from it ۚ and establish the prayers and the zakat and the loan of God With God, he is good and great reward.
74|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
74|2|Arise, warn
74|3|And your Lord is old
74|4|And your reward is purified
74|5|And the struggle
74|6|And do not be more intense
74|7|And your Lord is patient
74|8|So if we decide in the Naqur
74|9|So, day, day
74|10|On the disbelievers, it is not easy
74|11|I missed me and who created alone
74|12|And I made him a tired money
74|13|And sons of witnesses
74|14|I paved the way for him
74|15|then coveted for more
74|16|No, it was a stubborn signs
74|17|I will make him difficult
74|18|He thought and appreciated
74|19|Kif was killed
74|20|Then Kif was killed
74|21|Then look
74|22|Then he made and made
74|23|Then he managed and arrogant
74|24|said this is an effect Magic
74|25|If this is only the saying of human beings
74|26|I will reach it.
74|27|And I don’t know what is decided
74|28|It will be devastating
74|29|A portion of good news
74|30|It has a nineteenth
74|31|And we did not make the owners of the fire except for the angels ۙ and what we have made them except for those who have disbelieved to those who disbelieved to be able to do so I am, and those who have the book and the believers do not He wills and guides whom he wantsۚ And what the soldiers of your Lord knows only is he ۚ and what is only a remembrance of good news
74|32|No and the moon
74|33|And the night, when I admire
74|34|And the morning when it travels
74|35|It is not the oldest
74|36|A vow to good news
74|37|Whoever wants you to be advanced or delayed
74|38|Every soul is what it has earned
74|39|Except the owners of the right
74|40|In gardens they ask
74|41|From the criminals
74|42|What will have you in a satellite
74|43|they said that they were not worshipers
74|44|We did not fed the poor
74|45|We were going into the duties
74|46|We were lying on the Day of Religion
74|47|Until we come
74|48|So what is the intercession of the two philosophers
74|49|So what they have to remember are exposed
74|50|As if they are a reddish red
74|51|It was escaped from a cruelty
74|52|Rather, each of them wants to be published.
74|53|No, but they do not fear the hereafter
74|54|However, it is a reminder
74|55|Whoever wants to mention it
74|56|And what they remember except that God wills ۚ He is the people of piety and the people of forgiveness
75|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
75|2|I do not swear by the blame
75|3|Is it not a person who is gathering his greatness
75|4|I am able to forget his sons
75|5|Rather, a person wants to relieve him
75|6|He asks where the day of resurrection
75|7|So if the eyesight is brightened
75|8|And the moon was lost
75|9|The sun and the moon
75|10|Man says on the day when the one is
75|11|No, no
75|12|To your Lord, the stable day
75|13|A man predicts the day of what has been presented and delayed
75|14|Rather, man on his soul is insignificant
75|15|And if he had met his excuses
75|16|Do not move with it for your tongue to hurry with it
75|17|We have to collect it and its Qur’an
75|18|So if we read it, then follow its Qur’an
75|19|Then we have to show him
75|20|No, but you love the speed
75|21|And you will come to the hereafter
75|22|Woods are a frequent day
75|23|To her Lord, a view
75|24|And it is a family
75|25|Do you think that the Vagherh
75|26|No, if it reaches the anxiety
75|27|It was said who is upset
75|28|He thought that it is the dignity
75|29|And the leg turned the leg
75|30|To your Lord, the argument
75|31|Do not believe or pray
75|32|But he lied and tied
75|33|Then he went to his family
75|34|First for you, first
75|35|Then you are first for you
75|36|Is a person to leave a bond
75|37|Did you not sperm from a semen?
75|38|Then it was a relationship, and he was created
75|39|He made the male and females of the male and females
75|40|Isn't that a measure that the dead will revive
76|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
76|2|We created the man from the sperm of tensions, and we would have made it a visionary hearing
76|3|We guided him to the way.
76|4|We are accustomed to the disbelievers, peaceful and pricing.
76|5|The righteous drink from the same as its mood as a blasting
76|6|A eyes drinking the worshipers of God, they explode it as a trivial.
76|7|They died in the warning and fearing a day that was bad.
76|8|And they feed the food on his love, poor, orphaned and captive.
76|9|But we fill you for the face of God, we do not want a reward from you or a complaint
76|10|We are afraid of our Lord on the day of the ritual rituals
76|11|So God blessed them with the evil of that day, and they met them with freshness and pleasure.
76|12|And they rewarded them with what they were patient and heaven
76|13|In which you are leaning on your opinions ۖ They do not see them as a sun or a decree
76|14|And a decrease upon them is their shadow and humiliation is humiliated.
76|15|And it is circumcised with a verse from a silver and a cook.
76|16|Agreement from the silver that they appreciated in appreciation
76|17|And they will be watered in it as a good.
76|18|In it, it is called Selbil
76|19|And they are floating on them.
76|20|And if you saw, then you saw a great king
76|21|They are the garments of Green, and to be broken.
76|22|If you have a reward, and your endeavor was grateful
76|23|We have revealed the Qur’an to you.
76|24|Be patient with the judgment of your Lord, and do not obey from them sin or disbelief
76|25|And remember the name of your Lord
76|26|And from the night, he will find it and praised him for a long night
76|27|They love the urgent and their success
76|28|We created them and tightened their families.
76|29|This is a remembrance of him 😂 Whoever wants to take to his Lord as a way
76|30|And what God wills, God wills ۚ God was a wise knowledge
76|31|He enters whom he wills in his mercy ۚ and those who are unjust have a painful torment for them
77|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
77|2|The descriptions are described
77|3|And the publishers are published
77|4|Varks are separate
77|5|Flames are mentioned
77|6|Sorry or vow
77|7|Rather, you will come to a fact
77|8|So when the stars are touched
77|9|And if the sky is wrapped
77|10|And if the mountains are sorry
77|11|And if the messenge
77|12|For what day it was postponed?
77|13|For the day of separation
77|14|And what I realize what is the day of separation
77|15|And at that time for the lies
77|16|Did we not destroy the first
77|17|Then we follow them the last two
77|18|As we do with the criminals
77|19|And at that time for the lies
77|20|Didn't we create you from a humiliating water?
77|21|So we made it a place
77|22|To the amount of information
77|23|We appreciated us, and we were blessed
77|24|And at that time for the lies
77|25|Did we not make the earth as shrouds
77|26|Hey and dead
77|27|And we made it as sullen, and we watered you with water.
77|28|And at that time for the lies
77|29|They went to what you were lying
77|30|They went to the shadow of three people
77|31|There is no shadow, nor does it sing from the flame
77|32|It is threw up as a mineral as the palace
77|33|As if it was a yellow
77|34|And at that time for the lies
77|35|This day they do not speak
77|36|They do not give permission for them, and they will be excused
77|37|And at that time for the lies
77|38|This is the day of separation.
77|39|If you have a good, then you will be sure
77|40|And at that time for the lies
77|41|Those who are righteous in shadow and eyes
77|42|And his frustration from what they desire
77|43|Eat and drink here what you were doing
77|44|So do I. We recompense benefactors
77|45|And at that time for the lies
77|46|Eat and enjoy a little
77|47|And at that time for the lies
77|48|And when they are told, they kneel, do not kneel
77|49|And at that time for the lies
77|50|In what hadith after it believes?
78|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
78|2|On the great prophecy
78|3|They are in which they are different
78|4|They will not know
78|5|Then they will know
78|6|Did we not make the earth a skilled
78|7|And the mountains are going
78|8|We created you wives
78|9|And we have made your sleep causes
78|10|And we made the night a dress
78|11|We made the day a pension
78|12|And our sons are seven as a seven
78|13|And we made a mortal and a hole
78|14|And we got off
78|15|Let us leave it with love and prophecy
78|16|Falf's sheets
78|17|The day of separation was a certainty
78|18|The day is blown in the pictures, and you will come to waging
78|19|The sky opened, and it was doors
78|20|The mountains were gone, and it was a Sarb
78|21|Hell was observant
78|22|For the migrants a mob
78|23|There are no rights in it
78|24|They do not taste in it, nor a drink
78|25|Except a dumper and an wash
78|26|Agreement
78|27|They were not hiring a account
78|28|And they lied to our verses as a liar
78|29|And everything we counted as a book
78|30|So taste, and we will only increase you torture
78|31|For those who are righteous
78|32|Edes and grapes
78|33|And the people of the dirt
78|34|And as well as a delicacy
78|35|They do not hear in it, nor liar
78|36|A reward from your Lord, a gift
78|37|Lord of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them, the Most Merciful.
78|38|The day of the spirit and the angels rises in a class.
78|39|That right today sweap
78|40|We warn you with torment, a day that looks at what is presented to him, and the disbeliever says, O, if I wish you were dust
79|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
79|2|And activities are active
79|3|And the swimming pools are praise
79|4|Forens are preceded
79|5|So the mastermind is an order
79|6|The day of the shivering
79|7|It follows the navigator
79|8|Duffed hearts
79|9|Its sight is humiliating
79|10|They say that we are in the hole
79|11|If we are a great bone
79|12|They said that is a losing hatred
79|13|It is only one
79|14|So if they are with the sacrifice
79|15|Did Moses's hadith come to you?
79|16|When his Lord called him in the sanctuary of the sanctuary.
79|17|He went to Pharaoh, he is overwhelmed
79|18|Say: Are you to you?
79|19|And guide you to your Lord, and you will be afraid
79|20|So the great verse sees it
79|21|So he lied and disobeyed
79|22|Then I can see
79|23|So he called out
79|24|He said: I am your Lord, the Most High
79|25|So God took him as the last and the first
79|26|In that is a lesson for those who fear
79|27|You are the most created or heaven
79|28|He raised her thickness and settled
79|29|And I was covered with her night and broke her sacrifice
79|30|And the land after that
79|31|It was brought out of her water and her sponsorships
79|32|And the mountains have established it
79|33|Muta'ah for you and your insults
79|34|So if the oldest is the greatest
79|35|The day the man remembers what he has sought
79|36|And the hell was highlighted to whom he sees
79|37|As for those who want
79|38|And the impact of this worldly life
79|39|For hell is the dead
79|40|As for those who fear the position of his Lord, and the soul is forbidden from the passion
79|41|Paradise is the dead
79|42|They ask you about the hour, while it is anchored
79|43|You are one of her remembrances
79|44|To your Lord, his end
79|45|You are the warning of those who fear it
79|46|As if they saw it, they did not live except for a long time or sacrifice it
80|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
80|2|The blindness came to him
80|3|And what he realizes, perhaps he will be blessed
80|4|Or it is mentioned, then the remembrance will benefit it
80|5|As for those who seek me
80|6|You have a confrontation
80|7|And what you do not have to do
80|8|As for those who come to you, seek
80|9|He fears
80|10|You are distressed
80|11|It is not a reminder
80|12|Whoever wants to mention it
80|13|In the honorable newspapers
80|14|Purifetry
80|15|With my travel
80|16|A righteous drama
80|17|Man was killed
80|18|From anything that he created
80|19|From a sperm created by his destruction
80|20|Then the way is easy
80|21|Then his nations, and he set it up
80|22|Then if he wants to spread it
80|23|No, what he commands what he commanded
80|24|Let the man see its food
80|25|We poured water in the water
80|26|Then our earth was slit up
80|27|So we have been loved in it
80|28|And a curse and a penis
80|29|Ziton and a joke
80|30|Iders are overpowered
80|31|Father and father
80|32|Muta'ah for you and your insults
80|33|So if the good comes
80|34|The day of the woman escapes from his brother
80|35|And his mother and father
80|36|And his friend and sons
80|37|Each of them has a day that enriches it
80|38|Woons of the day traveling
80|39|A lavish laughter
80|40|And it is a dust on it
80|41|Its mourning is a prestige
80|42|Those are the disbelief
81|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
81|2|And if the stars are confirmed
81|3|And if the mountains are walked
81|4|And if the twentyness is disturbed
81|5|And if the wickedness is rampant
81|6|And if the sea is carried out
81|7|And when the souls are married
81|8|And if the budget is asked
81|9|of what guilt she was killed
81|10|And if the newspapers are published
81|11|And if the sky is scattered
81|12|And if the hell is happy
81|13|And when Paradise is destroyed
81|14|I knew the same
81|15|I do not swear by the gin
81|16|Neighborhoods
81|17|And the night if it is Asia
81|18|And the morning when it breathes
81|19|It is a generous Messenger
81|20|A force when a throne McCain
81|21|Obedient, then safe
81|22|And what is your friend with madness
81|23|And he saw it with the clear horizon
81|24|And what is on the unseen with two ads
81|25|And what is the saying of Satan is a dominant
81|26|Where are you going
81|27|It is only a male for the two worlds
81|28|Whoever wants you to be upright
81|29|And what you want except that God wills, Lord of the Worlds
82|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
82|2|And if the pillars are affected
82|3|And if the sea is immoral
82|4|And if the graves are stunned
82|5|I knew the same
82|6|O man, what is deceived by your generous Lord
82|7|Who created Fssoak Fdlk
82|8|In any picture, what you want is your knee
82|9|No, but you are lying in the debt
82|10|And if you have to be kept
82|11|Classes as two writers
82|12|You know what you do
82|13|The righteous is in a naked
82|14|And the leaving is in hell
82|15|They prayed on the Day of Religion
82|16|And what they are from it with great absences
82|17|And what I know is the day of religion
82|18|Then what I realize the day of religion
82|19|A day that does not have a soul for something
83|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
83|2|Those who when they are fired on people, they will be fulfilled
83|3|And if they scaled them or measured them, they would lose
83|4|Those not think they envoys
83|5|For a great day
83|6|The day of the people of the Lord of the two worlds
83|7|However, the writer of the leaving is in a prison
83|8|And what I realize what is imprisoned
83|9|A book of sterile
83|10|And at that time for the lies
83|11|Those who lie to the Day of Religion
83|12|And what is denying it except every sinful aggressor
83|13|If our verses are followed by him, the myths of the first said:
83|14|No, but they were in their hearts.
83|15|However, they are from their Lord.
83|16|Then they are the hell
83|17|Then it is said that this is what you were lying
83|18|However, the book of the righteous is on the authority
83|19|And what they realize what they are
83|20|A book of sterile
83|21|The closest witnesses it
83|22|The righteous is in a naked
83|23|On your opinions, they look
83|24|Know their faces
83|25|They are watered from a church
83|26|His conclusion is a musk ۚ And in that, let them compete with the competitors
83|27|And its mood is from Tsanim
83|28|A eye that is close to those who are close
83|29|Those who were deceived were among those who believed
83|30|And if they pass by them, they will be overlooked
83|31|And when they turned to their people, they turned
83|32|And when they saw them, they said that these people are lost
83|33|And what they sent to them are preserved
83|34|Today, those who believe in disbelievers are laughing
83|35|On your opinions, they look
83|36|Is the disbelievers what they did?
84|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
84|2|She gave permission to her Lord
84|3|And if the land is extended
84|4|She threw what is in it and gave birth
84|5|She gave permission to her Lord
84|6|O man, you are a toil to your Lord as a toile
84|7|As for those who have given his book with his right
84|8|So the account is calculated
84|9|And it turns to his family
84|10|As for those who have given his book and behind his back
84|11|So they called a bitter
84|12|It is valid
84|13|He was in his family a pleasure
84|14|He thought that he would not be speaking
84|15|I would like his Lord with his vision
84|16|I do not swear by the horizons
84|17|And the night and what is made
84|18|And the moon if it is consistent
84|19|Let us ride a class
84|20|So what they do not believe
84|21|And if the Qur’an is read to them, they will not find ۩
84|22|Rather, those who disbelieve are lying
84|23|And God knows what they are
84|24|He preached them with a painful torment
84|25|Except those who believe and do righteous deeds for them, they have a reward that is not.
85|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
85|2|And the day
85|3|And witness and witnesses
85|4|The owners of the old people were killed
85|5|The fire is the steps
85|6|If they have a lies
85|7|And they are what they do with the believers are witnesses
85|8|And we do not take place from them except that they believe in God, dear
85|9|He who has the king of heavens and the earth ۚ And God is upon everything that is martyr
85|10|For those who destroyed the believers and the believers, then they did not repent, so they have the torment of hell, and they have the torment of the pious
85|11|Those who believe and do righteous deeds have gardens that run from underneath
85|12|The oppression of your Lord is hardening
85|13|He is starting and returning
85|14|He is the forgiveness
85|15|The glorious throne
85|16|Effective for what he wants
85|17|Did the hadith of the soldiers come to you?
85|18|Pharaohs and thunder
85|19|But those who disbelieved in a lie
85|20|The God of the surroundings behind
85|21|Rather, it is a glorious Qur’an
85|22|In a hidden wave
86|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
86|2|And what I know is what the ritual
86|3|Piercing star
86|4|If every soul is preserved
86|5|Let man see what was created
86|6|It was created from a dug water
86|7|It comes out from the crucifixion and the chairs
86|8|It is for his return to Qaddar
86|9|The day of the wicked
86|10|So what is of power, and no supporter
86|11|And the sky with a return
86|12|And the earth with the righteousness
86|13|It is a chapter
86|14|And what is the misery
86|15|They are sure
86|16|And I am sure
86|17|So the disbelievers are the same as their people
87|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
87|2|He who created
87|3|And who was destined to guide
87|4|And that brought the shepherd
87|5|So he made him a nausea
87|6|We will read you, do not forget
87|7|Except for what God wills ۚ He knows the wickedness and what is hidden
87|8|And we are pleased with the secret
87|9|Remember if you benefit the remembrance
87|10|He will remember who fears
87|11|And it is avoided by the hardship
87|12|The one who prayed the great fire
87|13|Then there is no death in it or alive
87|14|I have succeeded
87|15|And he mentioned the name of his Lord
87|16|Rather, you affect the worldly life
87|17|And the hereafter is better and remained
87|18|This is in the first newspapers
87|19|The newspapers of Ibrahim and Moses
88|1|In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
88|2|A face of a humble day
88|3|An anchor worker
88|4|A protective fire
88|5|It is watered from an eye
88|6|They have no food except for a sacrifice
88|7|It is neither as a result nor sings from hunger
88|8|Smart, signs
88|9|Her pursuit is satisfied
88|10|In a high paradise
88|11|Do not hear it in it
88|12|There is a majestic eye
88|13|It has a bright bed
88|14|And the curtains are subject
88|15|And we are the Marfoufa
88|16|And my corpse
88|17|Do you not look at the camels, how they are created
88|18|And to the sky, how was she raised
88|19|And to the mountains, how did it erect
88|20|And to the earth, how was it flattened
88|21|Remember, but you are a remembrance
88|22|You are not on a barrier
88|23|Except for those who took over and disbelieved
88|24|And God is tormented by the greatest
88|25|We have their wings
88|26|Then we have their account
89|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful
89|2|And ten nights
89|3|And the lips and the time
89|4|And the night if it is easy
89|5|Is there a section for a stone?
89|6|Did you not see how your Lord did
89|7|Think of the pamphlet
89|8|Which was not created in the country
89|9|And the steadfastness of those who answered the rock
89|10|And the two people who are bodied
89|11|Those who overwhelmed the country
89|12|So they would have corruption
89|13|So, your Lord is a torment of torment
89|14|Your Lord is on the basis
89|15|As for man, when his Lord has been broken, he will be honored and blessed, so he says my Lord, I am honored
89|16|As for what he has seen, he is able to live him
89|17|No, but you do not honor the orphanage
89|18|And do not embrace the food of the poor
89|19|And you eat heritage
89|20|And you love money
89|21|Not when the earth is destroyed
89|22|And your Lord and the king came in a description
89|23|And the coming of the time of the hell ۚ then the man remembers the man and I have the remembrance of it
89|24|"He says, ""I wish you came to my life"
89|25|So, no one is tortured by one
89|26|No one is documented
89|27|O, the soul, the soul
89|28|Go back to your God satisfied
89|29|So enter me into my servants
89|30|And enter my paradise
90|1|In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
90|2|And you are a solution with this country
90|3|And the father and what is born
90|4|We have created man in a life
90|5|Is it not possible for anyone to be appreciated
90|6|I say I have money
90|7|Is it not possible that no one sees it
